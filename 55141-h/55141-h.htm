<p>To the Members of the twenty-eighth
Congress, Senators, Representatives and
their officers, this little volume is respectfully
dedicated, as a small token of
high regard for them, as officers of the
government of the United States, and as

<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>This small volume is the first of a series,
which the author proposes to write for the
amusement, and he hopes, for the information
of his countrymen. This is “Mysteries,”
the next will be “Humbugs of Washington
city” and the third volume if deemed
necessary, to reform the public morals, will
be “the crimes of Washington city.” Whoever
reads this little work, will find in it no
malice, nor even ill will towards individuals,
whom the author wishes to reform, not
to destroy, by exposing vice and recommending
virtue in its loveliness and beauty.
He is happy to be able to say, that the
people of this district have been growing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
better during twenty years past. Several
of the Departments, perhaps all of them,
are better conducted than formerly. There
is in them a better system. We refer more
especially to the Treasury Department—the
General Land Office and the Department
of the General Post Office. The State
Department is and always was well enough.
All party spirit has been carefully avoided
in writing this little book. Feeling no ill
will towards any one, for opinion’s sake,
the author has expressed none towards the
good men with whom he has freely associated
during several months past. Treated
kindly himself by men of all parties, he has
endeavored to treat them as they have
treated him, during this protracted session
of Congress. In his <em>next volume</em> he proposes
to describe the Patent Office, the War
Office and the Navy Department. He
hopes to be able soon to begin his visits to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
them, and continue his visits until he understands
fully what is in those departments,
so that the people can learn correctly
whether <em>common report</em> be true or false
respecting them. <span class="smcap">The Indian bureau will
be examined.</span></p>

<p>Errors in this first edition of an original
work could not be avoided, and the reader,
it is hoped, will correct them as he reads
the work the first time. Unless this volume
is soon sold, his next work, “<span class="smcap">The Humbugs</span>”
will be put to the press when Congress
rises. The author will <em>take off his
gloves</em> when he writes that volume during
the dog-days.</p>

<p>Leaving Columbus, the seat of government,
in the State of Ohio, on the morning
of the twenty-sixth of November, in the
stage, in company with six or seven passengers,
we arrived at Wheeling, in Virginia,
in exactly twenty-four hours. The
distance is somewhat over one hundred and
thirty miles. We passed over the National
road, then in a good condition for travelling
on it. Stopping at the Virginia Hotel in
Wheeling, we ascertained that we were
too late for the stage that would pass over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
the road to Cumberland, in season for the
rail-road cars next morning; and so we
concluded to tarry where we were, until
next day. Resting ourselves here that day,
and laying by sleep enough for the route
between Wheeling and Cumberland, we
took an early start the next morning, and
passed over the Alleghanies during the
succeeding night. We travelled some fifty
miles or upwards on the ridge of that mountain,
which is four thousand feet above the
ocean, and on one point it is nearly, if not
quite, five thousand feet in height. It was
extremely cold, and the snow was several
inches in depth. The cracks in the doors
and windows of the stage, admitted the
piercing cold more freely than we could
have wished. We were nine in number,
and were quite incommoded and uncomfortably
stowed away. The stage driver
insisted on stopping at every tavern, that
we passed, almost, during the night, and
the tavern keepers themselves were quite
importunate, and strove to induce us to stop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
and warm ourselves by their large coal fires
in their bar-rooms.</p>

<p>These arts of stage drivers and tavern
keepers combined, detained us so long, notwithstanding
all our exertions to prevent it,
that they produced the effect which it was
intended to produce: we arrived at Cumberland,
in Maryland, about two hours too
late for the cars that day, and so we were
detained at that town until next morning.
If the tavern keepers at Wheeling and Cumberland
could be believed, though we had
our doubts, they were excessively offended
at all who were concerned in delaying us
on our route, viz.: the stage agent at Wheeling,
and the drivers and tavern keepers on
the mountain, from the top of Laurel Hill,
to Frostburgh inclusive. On the last day
of December, 1843, we left Cumberland
early in the morning, and in ten hours we
were safely landed in Baltimore, passing
over one hundred and eighty miles of rail-road
in that period of time. For such a
distance, of continuous rail-road, this is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
most excellent road, and the ride is a very
pleasant one. Our stoppages were neither
numerous nor did we tarry long at any one
place. At Harper’s Ferry we stopped to
dine, but prefering to take our refreshment
in the cars, we were gratified in that way,
thereby saving one-half the expense and
one-half the usual time of tarrying here to
take a regular dinner. The towns through
which we passed, between Cumberland and
Baltimore, are small ones, but are improving
in appearance. In Baltimore I stopped
at Bradshaw’s, near the depot, and there
found a good, comfortable room, a good
bed, and good breakfast for one dollar.
Leaving Baltimore in the cars at 8 o’clock,
A. M., we reached Washington city, at 10
o’clock, in the morning, on New Year’s day.
I had expected to have seen, at least, one
hundred thousand people in Pennsylvania
Avenue, on New Year’s day, as I saw, on
that day fourteen years before. Now, I
saw no crowd, no bustle, and heard no
noise, and saw no stir. There was, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
as I learned at supper from some
clerks who boarded where I put up, a levee
of clerks and officers, who were dependants
on the heads of Departments, and they called
it “a crowd” of officers and office seekers?
The nation had increased in numbers,
greatly, since 1830, but only one thousand
officers attended at the White house that
day, whereas one hundred thousand people
thronged the Avenue fourteen years before!
Such was my impression from what I saw
and heard that day. The change was striking,
and told the different feelings of the
people towards the Captain, from those formerly
evinced towards the old General. I
leave it to the reader to decide on the cause,
but the fact made an impression at the time,
and forced the comparison on my own mind,
on the first day of the year 1844. Both days,
that is, the first day of January 1830, and
New Year’s day 1844, were equally fair,
and the Avenue was now in a better condition
than formerly, made so, at a large expense,
by the nation. The officers of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
government had doubled in numbers around
the Chief Magistrate, but <span class="smcap smaller">THE PEOPLE</span> were
not here now.</p>

<p>I had been absent from the city ever
since early in August 1832, and it had undergone
a change in its exterior appearance,
in the mean time, of some magnitude. Its
vacant lots had been built on, in many places;
old buildings had been removed, and
new ones, many of them large and elegant
ones, had been erected in their stead. The
improvements about the public buildings:
the Capitol, the War office, the President’s
house, &amp;c., were considerable, and had cost
the nation large sums of money. Besides
these improvements, a new building of
large dimensions had been built instead of
the old Post Office, that fire had destroyed,
since I had been here. A new Patent Office,
of dimensions quite too large for any
use to which the nation ought to devote it,
had been built. The structure of this
building seemed to me, to be such, that it
will fall down in a few years. A new Treasury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Office of vast dimensions, had also been
built, since I had visited the city. Washington
had now assumed more of a city-like
aspect, instead of its old one, of a long straggling
village. More churches had been
built, in various parts of the city, and no disgusting
sights of beggars and prostitutes met
the eye. These circumstances added much
to my satisfaction on my first day’s visit to
the seat of Government. I met and shook
hands with many old friends, residing either
here or in Georgetown. Washington no
longer presents the outside of vice, and that
circumstance speaks highly of those, who
have so zealously laboured to improve
the morals, and mend the hearts, of the
great mass of the citizens. Their labors
must have been great, otherwise such success
would not have followed their works.</p>

<p>I attended, afterwards, divine service in
several of their churches in the city, and
once in the Episcopal church, with General
Archibald Henderson’s family, at the Navy
Yard, but I always found good preaching,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
and orderly, and even devout congregations
attending church. In the streets of
the city, I have never seen an intoxicated
person, whereas, twelve years since, I have
seen fifty such sights in a day. Many of
them were Members of Congress! During
this long visit of several months, constantly
visiting all the public places, I have not
seen one Member of Congress, either intoxicated
or in any wise misbehaving himself,
on any occasion.</p>

<p>There may be vice here, but it no longer
exhibits its disgusting front in public, and
I have not sought for it, nor wished to find
it. It is true, the passengers see signs in
several places on the Avenue, with the
words “BILLIARDS,” or “BILLIARD SALOON,”
printed on them, but otherwise,
the stranger would not know without inquiry,
where the gamblers resort for gaining
what they call an “honest livelihood.” The
reflections I drew from such premises, assure
me of an improved state of morals, in the
nation itself, in many respects. We may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
hope that moral feelings and moral principles,
will one day govern this great Republic,
through its representatives, in our
legislative assemblies.</p>

<p>Let us hope, too, that the day is not far
off, when our highest officers, civil, naval,
and military, will be sober, honest, and
moral men. Many, perhaps all, or nearly
all, of our older officers are such men even
now—such men as General Henderson, Col.
Abert, General Bomford, General Gibson,
Col. Totten, General Towson, Maj. Lewis,
Judge Blake, M. St. Clair Clarke, and many
others, are such men now. The high respect
in which these men are held by all
who know them, will have a good effect
on all their subordinates. The low estimation,
likewise, in which men in high places,
of an opposite character, are held here and
elsewhere, will produce its good effects also.
They stand out as beacons on the ocean of
life, to warn off every mariner from such an
iron bound coast. The success which has
always attended the sons and daughters of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
such good men, and the total ruin which
has followed, and overwhelmed the children
of wicked officers of government,
teach the same lessons of prudence, wisdom,
and virtue.</p>

<p>It argues but poorly in favor of an aristocracy
in this country, to see, in the offices,
as minor clerks, the sons of highly respectable
fathers, unless it be in cases, where a
man with a family is reduced by misfortunes
and losses, by untoward events,
without any fault of his; or he may have
been a literary man, like William Darby.
In such a case, the government may, on the
purest principles of morals, give such a man
some easy place as a shelter in his old age.
Such an act ought to rescue such a head of
department from oblivion. Judge Blake deserves
and receives his reward in the good
opinion of all good men.</p>

<p>Speaking of clerks, it is to be regretted
that the young men of this district should,
early in life, accept of a clerkship, instead
of setting out at once for themselves, whereby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
they can be more independent and have
a better prospect of rising in the world as
respectable men and useful ones too, than
a clerkship can ever afford them. I was
told that it was no very uncommon sight to
see in a day one hundred such young men
in office hours, walking the streets, standing
in refectories, drinking spirits, or lounging
about the lobbies of the two houses, or
sauntering about the rotundo with an umbrella
over their heads, leading about some
female friend! I was told also, that while
these loafers were thus engaged, the older
clerks and older men with families to support,
were over worked in their several offices.
One hundred such clerks with high
salaries, (often the highest ones) ought to be
dismissed in a day, and substitutes found in
the western states, who have almost nothing
here in the departments. Such a state of
things would sink any administration in the
estimation of all the West.</p>

<p>I give this story for what it is worth, and
for the sake of unity, in relation to the appointment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
of clerks, whose residence is in
the District, we relate here another anecdote,
which, in order of time belongs to a
more recent era than the early part of our
present visit. On the morning of the day
when Messrs. Gilmer and Wilkins were nominated
to the Senate, for the purpose of
getting those nominations made that day,
I called at the White House very early in
the morning, and being the first on the spot
by half an hour, the President, in accordance
with his usual politeness towards me,
directed the messenger to give to me, as
the first one that morning whom he would
see, the key of the door that led to the
President’s room, up stairs. I took the key
and opened the door, putting my hand
against the door case to prevent an ugly old
woman getting ahead of me, on my way
to see the President; but the old lady
stooping under my arm and running before
me, cried out aloud, “W...... ought to
be clerk, W...... ought to be clerk.” She
kept before me, running a race, thus proclaiming,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
at the top of her voice, until she
reached the President’s room, where seating
herself without leave or licence, she
continued her clamor for some minutes.—Finally,
finding no opportunity to be alone
with the Chief Magistrate, I opened to him
my business, notwithstanding the presence
of this old witch of Endor. She declared
that “although they had lived in the District
almost one whole year, yet during all
that long period they had procured no office
yet.” They had kept boarders, for which
they had received only thirteen dollars a
week for each boarder! They had been
compelled, it seems, to hire a man at ten
dollars a month, to wait on the boarders!
yet neither her husband nor her son-in-law
had received any office yet. Hearing that
two Secretaries were to be nominated that
day, she modestly insisted on “her husband’s
being a clerk under one of them.”
The President told her, “that he had nothing
to do with such appointments, which
he left to the Secretaries to make.” It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
seems, from the best information I could
obtain, that women, belonging to this District,
and parts of Maryland and Virginia
near Washington, come here, constantly
soliciting offices for their sons, husbands
and other relatives. That they have often
succeeded, is evident enough to the public
injury, and to the injury of the public officers
themselves. Were the same rules
adopted now, that Jefferson and Madison
adhered to formerly, a vast deal of personal
inconvenience to the President would be
avoided. The Presidents, to whom I have
referred, required that all applications for
offices should be made in writing. If the
office was derived from the President and
Senate, the application had to be made to
the President; but if the office applied for
came from a Secretary, then he only was
addressed, but it must be in writing. A
story has been for some time past running
around the whole Union, during the last
year, in relation to the appointment of a
clerk. The tale itself is derived, we presume,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
from some officer here, yet is doubtless
wholly untrue. Could that officer be
believed, a woman, residing in or near the
District, frequently called to see the President,
in order to get her husband appointed
a clerk. After many vain attempts to
accomplish her wishes, she is represented
as having succeeded at last by informing the
Chief Magistrate, “that her husband was
entirely helpless in his bed from sickness,
and that she and her children must come
to want unless her husband was appointed
a clerk!”</p>

<p>Having recounted my first impressions
on my arrival here, I proceed in my personal
narrative. On the next day, early in the
forenoon of January second, I called on my
old friend, Major William B. Lewis, Second
Auditor, located in the War Office building,
whom I found disengaged. After a
few minutes’ conversation, he began to tell
me about how my business had been treated
in the War Office, by the late Secretary
of War and the present Commissioner of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Indian Affairs. He spoke an hour, in which
time he entirely acquitted President Tyler
of all participation in the oppression, of
which I had been the object. I had been
informed quite the reverse by our delegation,
on the authority of the men, who were
the only authors of all the injustice which
had been done to me. On the next day I
saw the man who had wronged me; and
although I did not even allude to his conduct
towards me, I became entirely satisfied
of his guilt, and so made up my mind
accordingly. The next step required me, I
thought, to make the proper apology to an
injured man, injured by his worst enemies,
who pretended to be his best friends. On
the first day that I called to see the President,
the members of Congress occupied
the President’s time so long, that I could
not see him that day. I called again next
day, and through the friendship of Judge
French of Kentucky, who spoke to the
western members then waiting to see the
President, and more especially through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
aid of the Hon. T. Jefferson Henley of Indiana,
I saw the President and conversed
with him about my claim. Mr. Henley lived
opposite Louisville, (when at home,) on
the Ohio river. He represented a part of
Indiana with which I was formerly well acquainted.
He stood by me, and insisted on
the President seeing me and conversing
with me on my business. The President
came out of his room to see me, instead of
inviting <em>me</em> into his room. He seemed not
to know what had been done, and he referred
me to Maj. Lewis for information;
but as the Auditor could not originate an
account, and, in as much too, as the then
Secretary of War, I well knew, could not
pass the Senate, I preferred deferring my
business until another Secretary of War had
been appointed. I therefore deferred the
presentation of any claim until a future day.</p>

<p>Walking along the avenue towards Gadsby’s,
I heard a loud voice behind me, and
turning around, I saw following me, with a
quick step, Levi Woodbury, now a Senator<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
from New Hampshire, formerly a Secretary,
first of the Naval, next of the Treasury department.
I was happy, indeed, to meet
such an old friend, after a separation of
more than eleven years’ continuance. He
was in the best health and spirits, and exacted
a promise from me, that I would spend
that evening with him and his family, at
Mrs. Hamilton’s, on the avenue. At early
candle light I went to see him, but, in addition
to his family, I found there a large
number of old friends, members of Congress
and others. It was a most agreeable meeting
of old friends, who had once been the
supporters of General Jackson. Old scenes
were recalled to our minds, and all were
very happy for the time being. Gov. Hill
of New Hampshire, was the only one who
did not laugh heartily on that occasion. His
nomination for some little office was before
the Senate for confirmation, and his fears,
if he had any, were well founded, because
his nomination was not confirmed, but rejected
not long afterwards by the Senate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Among the ladies present, were Mrs. Woodbury
and her three daughters. They are
New England’s best beauties—they have
handsome forms, and they are beautiful in
face, body and mind. The whole family,
father, mother and daughters, present one
of the best family groups I ever saw in my
whole life. Their persons, minds and manners
are in perfect keeping, of which New
Hampshire may well be proud, as ornaments,
physical, mental and moral, of the
Granite State. Seeing them, and listening
to their conversation, I thought, though I
did not say so, that, unless the unmarried
members of Congress had hearts harder
than granite itself, and colder than northern
icebergs, these young ladies would soon
have good husbands and good homes in our
delightful Great Western valley. Give us
millions of just such people in the West, to
cultivate and adorn the largest, the best
and most fertile valley on the whole globe.</p>

<p>Levi Woodbury was born in Francistown,
in New Hampshire, in the year 1790. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
father, Peter Woodbury, emigrated, when
quite young, from Beverly, in Massachusetts,
to the town where Governor Woodbury
was born. We do not propose in this biographical
notice of one who has successively
filled, with credit to himself and honor
to his native state, so many high and important
public stations, any thing more than a
mere passing notice of one of the most industrious,
polite, kind and useful men in the
present Congress. The early education of
Mr. Woodbury was acquired in the common
schools of his native town. During a short
period, he was employed, when young, a
mere youth of fourteen or fifteen years of
age, in teaching a school in Pepperell, in
Massachusetts. In 1805 he entered Dartmouth
college, and was regularly graduated
at that institution. As a scholar, he stood
very high in his class. This circumstance,
in addition to his devotion to literary pursuits,
in all probability, induced his alma
mater to confer on him the degree of LL. D.
at a subsequent period of his life. After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
graduating at Dartmouth college, Mr. Woodbury
studied law one year with Judge
Reeve, at Litchfield, Connecticut, and completing
his law studies at other places, was
admitted to the bar in 1812, and immediately
opened a law office in his native town.
At the time when Mr. Woodbury began his
career as a lawyer, party spirit ran high in
New Hampshire; the majority were opposed
to the war and the then administration
of the general government. Mr. Woodbury
supported the war, and often addressed public
meetings, and drew up and introduced
into them spirited resolutions, which produced
considerable effect on the minds of
his fellow citizens. During several years,
the party opposed to the war, governed the
State, until 1816, perhaps. During these
four years Mr. Woodbury rose into a great
practice at the bar, and stood high too as a
politician with his party. In 1816, when
his party had become a majority in the legislature,
he was elected clerk of the Senate.
In the next January he was appointed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
a judge of the superior court. Having at
such an early age been appointed to the
highest judicial station in the State, the
public attention was naturally turned towards
him. His quick apprehension, his
reach of thought, his firmness and moral
courage, rendered him a model, it is said,
of judicial deportment. His judicial decisions
are reported and held in high estimation
by the lawyers of New Hampshire. In
1823, Judge Woodbury was elected Governor
of the State, but returned to the practice
of the law in 1824. His law practice
was instantly considerable, and he was
sought for as a lawyer by persons in every
part of the State. In 1819 he was married
to Miss Clapp of Portland in Maine. In the
year 1825 he was elected a representative
from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to the
legislature. He had settled himself as a
lawyer, on his marriage, in Portsmouth. By
the legislature, to which he had been elected,
he was chosen Speaker of the House of
Representatives, and towards the close of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the session he was elected to the Senate of
the United States. We have been the more
careful to notice every step of Mr. Woodbury’s
advancement, until he reached the
United States Senate, because, as soon as
he appeared in that body, he was seen by
the whole nation; and from that time to
the present moment, he has always been
where the whole nation could see him.
His labors on committees, in the Senate,
have been great and useful to his country.
As Secretary of the Navy, and subsequently
Secretary of the Treasury department,
he has shown talents of a superior cast. It
is a striking fact, that he and his friend Cass,
of the same State originally, are possibly
the only men whom their party could, by
possibility succeed in electing at the next
presidential election.</p>

<p>To those who personally know Mr. Woodbury,
it is unnecessary to state, that in his
manners he is one of the most agreeable
men in the world. Finally, himself and
Mrs. Woodbury, have the most beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
well bred and polite family now attending
on this session of Congress. Their persons
are not less beautiful than their minds, their
manners and their hearts. I dismiss them
from any further notice in my book, with
the fervent desire that God may bless them.</p>

<p>Having tarried at Washington about eight
days, and having visited all the places and
persons that I then desired to see, I left the
city early in the morning, in the rail-road
cars, breakfasted in Baltimore at Bradshaws,
and reached Philadelphia about dark in the
evening. Stopping at the Mansion House
hotel, adjoining the depot, I visited Dr. S.
G. Morton, on Arch street, not far from my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
lodgings. He invited me to call on him the
next evening, which I did. Through the
day intervening, I visited some book-sellers
and book-binders, and saw and conversed
with several very agreeable and well educated
persons, citizens and strangers. The
Philadelphians are a very moral, well-informed
and good people. At Dr. Morton’s
I met a small circle of his friends, with
whom I spent agreeably several hours. The
Doctor and his lady have a family of very
promising sons and daughters, whom they
are educating in the best possible manner.
I saw Dr. Wistar at the hotel where I put
up, and where he boards. He is the son of
the celebrated Doctor of that name, but the
present Dr. Wistar does not wish to follow
the practice of his profession, and so he
does not follow it at present; at least, I so
understood him to say. Since I had seen
this city, it had greatly increased its dimensions
and improved its exterior appearance.
The Girard College buildings, the Merchants’
Exchange and the Almshouse, have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
been built since I had seen Philadelphia
before, and they added much to its exterior
aspect.</p>

<p>The building intended as a residence for
paupers, as we passed along the rail-road,
on my return from New York, in a pleasant
morning, on our right hand, across the
Schuylkill, standing on elevated ground,
made a splendid appearance. Had we not
known that it was the Almshouse, we might
have been tempted to believe it the residence
of some retired monarch of the old
world, who had come here, and at the expense
of a million of dollars or more, had
erected this splendid palace for a residence.
The traveller is generally treated a little
better, and charged a little less in Philadelphia,
than he is in any other Atlantic city.
As a whole, this city has always been celebrated
for its good qualities of all sorts, and
yet a few, a very few men here have done
not a little to injure its still fair character.
Its banks, bankers and bankrupts have
brought down ruin on many an honest man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and covered themselves, the authors of the
ruin, with shame and disgrace. The ruin
has fallen on the innocent only, while the
guilty have escaped condign punishment,
except one of them, whose death in all human
probability was occasioned by his mental
sufferings, at the loss of his character.—Peace
to his shade.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of January 10th, I
left the Mansion house, crossed the Delaware
and passed through the State of New
Jersey, in the rail-road cars, and arrived at
New York city about three o’clock in the
afternoon, in season for a dinner at a tavern
on Broadway, At dinner we had a printed
bill of fare in French. For drink, I had a
glass of Croton water, with ice in it, and
this, after a cold day’s ride, in the depth of
a cold, northern winter! Had I been a frozen
turnip, such water might have thawed
my frozen stomach, but as it was, hot coffee
or hot tea would have suited me much better.
I called for something to eat, but the
waiter in an insolent tone ordered me in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
German “to read my bill of fare,” and he
refused to give me any thing to eat. Finally,
after positively refusing to comply with
my request a dozen times, the ruffian gave
me a thin slice of roasted beef, which I ate
at a mouthful, and called in vain for more.
This mouthful of meat, with some cold Croton
water and some ice in it, was all I got
for my dinner! Half a dollar for such a dinner!
kind reader. I had the <em>bill of fare</em> lying
before me, but the <em>fare itself</em> I did not
and could not obtain. After sitting at the
table nearly an hour, faint, cold and hungry,
I went to my room, in which a small fire
had been made at my request, at the expense
of another half dollar. The room being
cold and damp, with so bad a prospect
before me, I locked my door, put the key
in my pocket, and went down Broadstreet,
until I came to Thresher’s Broadstreet hotel,
and told the host my story. He agreed to
furnish me the best fare, unaccompanied by
a bill of it, a good room to myself, warmed
constantly by a good coal fire, for one dollar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
a day. Upon these terms we agreed, and
I went back to the Broadway tavern. The
Broadstreet hotel is the same house, which
was occupied by General Washington as
his head quarters, when he took possession
of the city, after the British army had left
it, at the conclusion of the revolutionary
war. Standing in front of a large opened
window in the second story, his officers
standing before him in the street, below
him, General Washington delivered to them
his farewell address. From the house, his
officers accompanied him to the wharf, not
very distant from this spot, where he took
his final leave of his companions in arms.
Having crossed the ferry into New Jersey,
he hastened to appear before the continental
Congress, then sitting in Annapolis, the
now seat of government in the State of Maryland.
A painting in the rotundo, represents
Washington at Annapolis delivering his farewell
address to Congress.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of my bargain with the
landlord of the Broadstreet Hotel, I returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
to my first stopping place, and by dint
of argument, aided by several southern
guests, I got a warm supper, with warm coffee
and warm food, a little after ten o’clock
that night. I got some sleep that night
and a breakfast next morning, and paid a
bill of three dollars twelve-and-a-half cents,
for what I had! Although my door had always
been locked when I was out of it and
the key was in my pocket, yet that precaution
had not prevented my room from being
entered, my locked trunk’s being opened,
and several articles of no great value being
stolen from it—such as a shirt, a handkerchief
and a quire of writing paper. By ten
in the morning I was at my new lodgings,
where I continued some three weeks, while
I remained in New York. This Broadstreet
Hotel, on the corner of Pearl and Broad
streets, is within one minute’s walk of the
shipping, in the slip; it is one square from
Broadway, and the old Battery. At the
Battery there is playing constantly a splendid,
roaring fountain of Croton water. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
roars like a cataract in a still night. This
Hotel is near not only to all the shipping in
port, and the principal wholesale stores of
all sorts, but it is the headquarters of most
of the captain of vessels, which sail from
this city to all parts of the world. From
such a point, I found it an easy matter to
visit every part of this emporium. New
York, with its four hundred thousand people,
here, or in Brooklyn, is unquestionably
the first city on this continent. To fully
comprehend all the ideas necessarily belonging
to the wealth and resources of the
United States, a man must visit New York
and tarry some time there. Its streets,
compared with those of Philadelphia, are
narrow, crooked and dirty.</p>

<p>The first person whom I called to see,
merely as a friend, was Charles A. Clinton,
the eldest son of De Witt Clinton. Him I
found some few squares above the Park and
near Broadway. Here I found too Dr. Hosack,
the son of my old friend Dr. Hosack,
now deceased. It was quite gratifying to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
see the sons of my old friends, in the enjoyment
of good health and prosperous in the
world. Maj. Clinton had been clerk of the
Superior court, for some dozen or more
years, but had been removed from office, to
make room for some relative of one of the
judges of the court. This circumstance I
had previously learned through the newspapers,
about which Major Clinton said nothing.
I called several times afterwards to
see Major Clinton at his law office, nearly
opposite the Customhouse, in Nassau street.
He practices in partnership with Henry S.
Towner, Esq., a lawyer, originally from
Williamstown, Massachusetts. The lawyers
cluster around the Customhouse and
around the Merchants’ Exchange in Wall
street.</p>

<p>If law business is great in the city, the
number of those who follow the legal profession,
is great likewise. I became personally
acquainted with several lawyers
here, who are highly respectable as men,
as lawyers and as scholars. Among them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
may be mentioned <span class="smcap">George Folsom</span>, Esq.,
whose office is opposite the Exchange, on
Wall street. He is an author too. A son
of Colonel Gibbs, the geologist, is a lawyer
whose office is near the Exchange.</p>

<p>The bustle and crowd, the noise, the anxiety
on many faces, and the vast amount of
property of all sorts, such as cotton for instance,
in piles, blocking up streets, or moving
to and fro, between warehouses and
wharves—the masts of vessels, standing
along the shores of North river or those of
Long Island sound, strike the eye, as one
passes over the lower end of the city. Along
Broadway, the goods and the signs and every
thing, indeed, that possibly can catch
the eye and draw the attention of the stranger,
are not wanting, for a distance of two
miles from the Battery upwards. The citizens,
I believe, do not patronise the hotels
on Broadway, but prefer those in streets
farther eastward, as cheaper, more quiet
and better in all respects, than Broadway
houses. The retail stores are many of them
on Broadway, but the wholesale ones are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
lower down in the city. Wall street is full
of banks and insurance companies. The
Harpers’ great book establishment is in Cliff
street, near the old swamp, we believe. At
the foot of Fulton street is the ferry, which
crosses the East river to Long Island. This
is the greatest ferrying place in America.
We say this, though we are aware that a
place in Kentucky, is called “Great Crossings,”
yet Brooklyn ferry is a greater “crossing”
place, than the “Crossings” in Scott
county, Kentucky. I went over to Brooklyn
and called on the editor of the Long Island
Star—Alden Spooner, Esq. He is the
surrogate of the county where he resides,
and he devotes the most of his time to the
duties of his office. Of the forty thousand
people who live in Brooklyn, not a few of
them have stores, shops and offices in New
York city. Such men spend the day in the
city and sleep with their families on Long
Island at night. House rent is cheaper in
Brooklyn than it is in New York, and there
may be other reasons, such as the comparative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
quietness of a village, in Brooklyn,
which is not found in New York, except
some three miles up in the city. Brooklyn is
therefore nearer their business than the upper
part of New York would be; so Brooklyn
is preferred by men of business, as a family
residence, to the city itself.</p>

<p>Soon after my arrival in the city, as soon
as it was generally known, through the
newspapers, where I was located, I was
carried by Geo. Folsom, Esq. to the dwelling
house of Albert Gallatin, in Beekman
street. He and his lady received me most
cordially, as “a man, whom they had ardently
desired to see, (as they assured me) during
the last thirty years.” I found Mrs. Gallatin
a most interesting old lady, surrounded
by the neighboring ladies of that vicinity,
to whom she politely introduced me. After
a brief interview with these ladies below
stairs, we proceeded (Mr. Folsom and myself)
to Mr. Gallatin’s library room, where
we found him engaged in his favorite study
of the Indian languages of America. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
I am in an error, but as I understood
him, Mr. Gallatin had taken the Indian
words as spelt by Englishmen, Frenchmen,
Spaniards, Portugese, Americans, &amp;c. as the
true pronunciation of Indian words, which
by the Indians themselves, had never been
written. If he had done so, the true pronunciation
of the Indians themselves had
seldom been reached. Having been myself
engaged in writing down the language of
the Sioux, I am aware of the difficulty of
catching the exact sound of each word, and
the difficulty too, of expressing the exact
sound of the word, by means of our alphabet.
I saw at a glance the difficulty of his
position. I hinted at this circumstance, but
Mr. Gallatin did not fully comprehend my
meaning, and so I dropped the subject. No
alphabet now in use among men, can convey
all the sounds of any Indian language,
now or ever spoken in North America. Of
this fact I feel assured from my own knowledge
of Indian languages. The perfect
knowledge of these languages is more curious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
than useful, perhaps, in as much as the
Indians themselves will soon be gone, before
the Anglo-Americans, whose march
and conquests will soon obliterate every
vestige of the aboriginals of America.</p>

<p>Our regrets may and will follow the disappearance
of the Indians from the face of
the globe, but their doom is certain, and not
far off, in point of time. Our legislative
bodies, from the best of motives, are endeavoring
to preserve Indian names of places,
rivers, mountains, &amp;c., but our gross
ignorance of Indian languages, prevents us
from even retaining proper names. <em>Hoo</em>, for
instance, in some Indian dialects, means
elk, and <em>uk</em> is river, so <em>Hoosuk</em> means “elks
river.” “<em>Sooske</em>,” means hunting, and “<em>hannah</em>,”
in a Delaware dialect, means river.
<em>Sooskehannah</em> means “hunting river,” which
we call Susquehanna river.</p>

<p>No Indian, who heard us pronounce the
word <em>Potomac</em> would suspect that we meant
to say the river Potum; so of <em>Rappa-hannah</em>,
he would not know that we meant the river<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
<em>Rappa</em>. So of the river <em>Roan</em>, which we call
Roanoak, instead of calling it simply the
river <em>Roan</em>. But enough, perhaps, too much
of Indian languages. We give, however,
the names correctly: Hoo, Sooske, Potum,
Rappa and Roan. After spending several
hours with Mr. Gallatin in his library, and
after conversing with him on my business,
which had brought me to the city, in which
he took an interest, I returned to my lodgings
in Broad street. He invited me to call
on him again, and spend some time with
him, on his birth day, when he would be
eighty-three years old.</p>

<p>I next visited Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins and
their daughter, who boarded with Mrs.
Lentner, No. 15 Amity street, near Broadway.
In this house, kept by the present
occupant, Colonel Trumbull spent the last
twenty years of his life. Here he lived
and here he died, not long before my visit.
It was in this house that Colonel Trumbull
executed his splendid paintings which now
adorn the rotundo in the capitol at Washington<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
city. These paintings are seen by
a great number of persons every day in the
year. The Declaration of Independence,
the Surrender of Cornwallis, &amp;c. &amp;c. will
confer an unfading fame on Colonel Trumbull.
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lentner</span> will always be remembered
for her care of the painter,
which so greatly contributed to preserve
his useful life, until he was more than eighty-seven
years old. I saw in Mrs. Lentner’s
parlor a likeness of Colonel Trumbull,
painted by himself, in his last years. It
was said to be a very correct one. So said
Mrs. Lentner.</p>

<p>After taking dinner and supper with Mrs.
Lentner and her family, I returned in the
omnibus to my lodgings. If any persons
could prolong human life and render it happy,
Mrs. Lentner, her sister, and the domestics
around her, could certainly effect
that object. So it seemed to me during the
six hours that I spent at number 15, Amity
street, New York. She is the <span class="smcap">Mrs. Ballard</span>
of New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
On Mr. Gallatin’s birth day, when he had
arrived at the age of eighty-three years, I
went to see him as early in the morning of
that day as I could, after taking a very early
breakfast. I found him up in his library,
busily engaged in his favorite study of Indian
languages. He was quite active, quick
in his motions, his cheeks were ruddy, his
eye clear and piercing, his step elastic, his
eye sight, by the aid of his glasses, good.
He repeatedly ran up his ladder like a
squirrel to get a book for me. His hearing
is unimpaired, and his memory of past
events, wherein he had been concerned,
excellent. His reasoning powers were
good, and so was his judgment. On my
former visit I had, at his request, related to
him what I had known of the transactions
of his life, in which I had left many blanks,
especially when he had been in Europe as
our diplomatic agent. To-day Mr. Gallatin
filled up those blanks and recounted to me
what he had done, ever since he landed at
New York, a poor foreigner, ignorant of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
language, unlearned and not twenty years
old; but now I saw before me, at the age
of eighty-three, a man of wealth, of learning,
of great practical knowledge and of
vast mental powers, whose fame as a diplomatist,
as a man of business and as a statesman,
was co-extensive with the civilized
world. He more than once told me that
he was relating the manner in which he
had succeeded in life, so that I might profit
by his experience, whereas I expected to
die long years before he would. So I
thought, but said nothing, because any remark
in reply or by way of inquiry, seemed
to discompose his mind very much. In the
course of his long story of four or five hours
in length, he more than once gave the credit
of his success to his wife and her relatives
in New York. He had married a
daughter of Commodore Nicholson. She
had entered into all his concerns, political,
moral, social and mental with her whole
heart. She even watched the newspapers,
to learn what they said of Mr. Gallatin. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
related to me an anecdote of Mr. Gales,
who in his Intelligencer had said of Mr.
Gallatin, after his arrival in Washington,
“that the <em>venerable</em> Mr. Gallatin had arrived
in the city.” Soon after that paper appeared,
when a party of gentlemen had
convened to give Mr. Gallatin a public dinner,
perhaps, the latter gentleman said
aloud, so that all present heard him, “Mr.
Gales, my wife says, you make her husband
quite too venerable.” Mr. and Mrs. Gallatin
sent by me their best respects to all
their old friends in the District of Columbia,
with a very pressing request, that I
would give him an accurate account of
these friends, and what had befallen them
since January 1830, which was the last time
Mr. Gallatin had been in Washington city.
On my return to Washington I executed
my commission in a way that I supposed
would be satisfactory to all concerned—that
is, to Mr. and Mrs. Gallatin and to their
surviving friends in the District. On the
whole, we may safely pronounce Mr. Gallatin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
a very fortunate man, who, by his industry,
economy, perseverance and sleepless
energy, has acquired honors, wealth
and fame. Sixty years ago, he was a surveyor
of wild lands along and near the Ohio
river, naming the smaller streams that run
into that river, ascertaining the latitude and
longitude of particular points, and extending
his surveys quite into what is now the
State of Kentucky. George Washington
was a surveyor in that region at the same
time. Mr. Gallatin spoke of himself, as a
man in rather limited circumstances, whose
annual income amounted to only about five
thousand dollars. When he so informed
me, I thought that many a man in the western
States would consider himself well off,
provided he had that sum as his whole estate.
As to size, Mr. Gallatin is rather under
the common one, extremely well formed
in person, and has in his head a piercing,
hazle coloured eye. His memory is remarkably
good, and he is almost infinitely
better qualified to be the Secretary of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Treasury, than the man *******. His old
clerks all retain a warm friendship for him,
and so do their families. Mrs. Gallatin is
remembered by them, and all her old
neighbors in Washington, with heartfelt
gratitude, on account of her numerous unostentatious
hospitalities and charitable
acts. The comparison which all in this
city, who lived here in Gallatin’s time and
still reside here, are compelled to make, is
quite mortifying to their feelings. While
the mass of the people of Washington city
have become better, some of the higher officers
of the government have become
worse—much worse. Esconsed, malignant,
haughty, distant, reserved, lazy, inattentive
to the duties of their offices, one of them,
scarcely ever reaches his office until noon,
carrying his gold headed cane, horizontally
suspended in his hand, he signs his name
to a few papers, which Mr. ***** and his
clerks, *** and others had prepared for his
signature, and he departs to his house to
write for the newspapers against the administration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
one of which he is. A President
who would dare to brush off a musquito
from his hand, that was biting it, would
clear out such a fellow forthwith.<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> It is
an old maxim with me, “to mark the man,
whom God has marked.” When I see a
deformed mouth and a cocked eye, I expect
to find their owner a man actuated by
malice, treachery and deceit; a cold hearted
wretch, whom no one pities and no one
loves. Under some frivolous pretence, such
a creature hides himself in his house as an
owl does in his hollow tree in the day time,
and prowls, like the wolf or the owl, during
the night. That man’s father says, that his
son is the worst man in the world.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> While this form was passing through the press, the President brushed
off the musquito from his hand.—Thank you Sir.</p></div>

<p>During the time I was in New York city,
the Customhouse officers were kept very
busy. The duties on the imported goods
were of great amount, and the officers were
employed all day long in the open air, from
sun-rise till dark, when the thermometer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
was many degrees below zero. General
Waller was thus employed, weighing iron
from Sweden and Russia, all day long.</p>

<p>Goods by wholesale are sold much cheaper
in New York than I had supposed, and
I had no correct idea of the vast amount of
its commerce, until I had been in the city
two weeks. Considerable as the amount
of duties on goods received in this city, is,
yet the goods not paying any duty, such as
cotton, Orleans sugar, and domestic manufactures,
is still greater. The amount too,
of flour, wheat, corn, pork, beef, lard, &amp;c.,
brought here, is much more than I had supposed
it to be. When we have a despotism
in this country, all these goods will pay a
duty to the government. It might amount
to twenty millions of dollars annually, and
would then be a very low duty on domestic
products. We say this for the lovers of
low wages and free trade.</p>

<p>As this nation increases in numbers—as
the western States fill up with people—as
the amount of agricultural and manufactured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
goods increases, and as the foreign
goods, consumed in this great and
growing nation, increase, the city of New
York will increase its numbers of people,
its commerce, wealth and power. Her
ships and commerce will float on every sea
and every ocean, until she will rival London
herself in trade, wealth and power.
The position of New York, so near the
main ocean, on an island, laved too by the
North river and the Sound, affords every
facility which she needs or could desire, for
extending her commerce not only to foreign
countries, but into the interior of this
vast country. She will only need a rail-road
to the Pacific, and a dense population,
settled along its whole route, to enliven and
animate the scenery along its way. In that
event, steam vessels, running from Astoria
to China and Japan and all the islands of
the northern Pacific, would soon be seen
on the Upper Pacific, conveying the productions
of the whole world to a market.
Such a rail-road might be made by the nation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
from the land sales in the new regions
to be settled by our people. What a sublime,
moral, political and commercial prospect
is held out to our enraptured eyes!
Christians, statesmen, Americans and scholars,
look on this picture!</p>

<p>From surveys actually made by Lieut.
Freemont, it is certain, that a rail-road from
Cumberland, in Maryland, to the Pacific, is
entirely within our means as a nation, at an
expense of only about fifty millions of dollars
or less; and it is equally certain that
the new lands to be brought into market
by making the road, would defray every
dollar of the expense of making it. We
live in the infancy of the greatest nation
that now exists, ever did, or ever will exist,
on the face of the globe. Looking through
the vista of futurity, we can now behold a
nation consisting of five hundred millions of
people, all speaking our language, and governing
the world in peace without a rival
in commerce, arts or arms. Should the
British lion growl at us, the Gallic cock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
would flap his wings and crow at our success,
and the Russian bear smile upon us.
The American eagle will yet soar above
both, into his own pure air, where he can
revel in the brilliant beams of his own flaming
sun. The trade between the East Indies
and Europe will eventually pass across
our territory, east and west, and the time
of passing from London to Canton might
not occupy more than two months. Such
a state of things would add to the wealth,
numbers, commerce, agriculture and manufactures
of this whole nation. Such a nation,
whose territory extended from the Atlantic
to the Pacific, from the Icy sea in the north
to the Isthmus of Darien in the south, would
present a sublime spectacle. What a vast
field in which free government might exercise
its energies! The human imagination
is lost in its contemplation of such a
prospect, for the future generations of our
posterity.</p>

<p>Yet, certainly, such is the prospect
ahead, unless it be our own fault. The most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
difficult portion of the road to be made between
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, is
between Cumberland and Wheeling; and
yet that portion of it could be made in five
years after it was fairly began to be made
by the nation. The little questions of policy
and of party, now agitating so many little
minds, will be lost in oblivion, and higher,
nobler, better and more extended objects
and aims, will occupy higher, nobler and
better minds than are now employed on
political affairs. The little ants and their
mole hills, will give place to mammoths
and to Alps, in the intellectual, political
and moral world. Our destiny is in our own
hands, and unless we abuse all the gifts of
God to us, we shall be the most powerful
nation on earth. Let us hope that our people
will move forward in their career to its
ultimate grand end, unimpeded by factions
at home, or by force from abroad. The
more States we have in our confederacy,
the stronger we shall be as a nation. As
a great whole, the human mind has always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
moved forward, and we see no reason why
the American mind should stand still, or
stop short of its grand, final destiny, at the
very head of nations—of all nations on
earth. Nature’s God never intended that
the people of this great continent, should
be subservient to the people of Europe,
more than he did that the sun in yonder
firmament should descend from his orbit to
revolve around a pebble on our sea shore,
as his centre of gravity. No. We inhabit
a great and mighty continent, blest with
every soil, climate, plant and animal which
the earth contains. Our people, too, derive
their origin from every other people almost
who live on this globe. Let us throw aside
as useless, and worse than useless, all low
aims, and soar like our own eagle into purer
air.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Return to Washington.—The different degrees of temperature in the atmosphere

New York to Washington inclusive.—Long interview with the President.
His misfortunes rather than his faults.—His cheerfulness, and his views

citizens.</p></blockquote>

<p>Having determined to return to Washington
city, I wrote to the innkeeper of the
Mansion house hotel at Philadelphia, to
have my room warm for me at 11 o’clock,
P. M. and entering the evening cars at Jersey
city in the evening, we were carried
across the State of New Jersey, and crossing
the Delaware with some difficulty, on
account of the ice in the river, I arrived at
Philadelphia, and was in a good warm bed,
in a warm room, before eleven o’clock at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
night, at Horter’s Mansion house, corner of
11th and Market streets, Philadelphia.—The
ride across the State of New Jersey,
in a bright moonlight night, was as agreeable
as it could be, we being able to see
each town as we passed through it. The
cars were well warmed by stoves; we were
not too much crowded to be comfortable,
and we had agreeable company enough to
render our journey pleasant. Lodging at
Philadelphia, next morning after breakfast
I entered the cars for Baltimore, and arrived
at Washington city exactly twenty-five
hours after I had left New York. This
last day’s ride was perhaps on the second
day of February. The different degrees of
temperature in the atmosphere during the
month of January, was seen in the thickness
of the ice in the North, the Delaware,
in the Susquehanna and the Potomac rivers.
In the North river the ice was fourteen
inches in thickness, in the Delaware ten
inches, and eight inches in the Susquehanna,
but not more than six inches in the Potomac.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
The city of New York, located on
an island that lies high, and is exposed to
every breath of air that moves in any direction
over the land or the water, is colder
than its latitude would seem to indicate.
The current in the river and in the Sound,
owing to a tide of from seven to eleven feet
in height, rising and falling every few
hours, prevents any very great inconvenience
to ships, either entering into or leaving
the harbor in the coldest winter weather.</p>

<p>I was no more fatigued by my journey,
than if I had been sitting in my room at
the Broadstreet hotel. The passage money
between Washington city and New York,
is only ten dollars and fifty cents, yet, for
handling trunks, for refreshments on the
way, and tavern bills, added to car fare, we
may safely say that it costs the passenger
fifteen dollars between Washington city
and New York.</p>

<p>Soon after my return to Washington, I
spent an entire evening with the President,
from early candle lighting until after nine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
o’clock. He had invited the Rev. Mr. Gurley,
and a gentleman from Memphis, Tennessee,
to visit him that evening. These
gentlemen tarried an hour or so, when I
was left alone with the President. He conversed
very freely on the colony of Liberia,
and expressed a wish to see it become a
nation, independent, but under the protection
of the United States and of England.
He dwelt on that subject during an hour.
He was quite eloquent on the prospect
when Virginia would send off her slaves to
Liberia, and become a great manufacturing
State, and in that way at length assume
her old supremacy, standing at the head of
the Union in numbers and wealth. The
President said that he owned some thirteen
slaves, which he bought, to prevent their
being carried South. He appeared to be
entirely willing to set them free, and let
them emigrate to Liberia. To him they
had been valueless, and so would remain a
burden on his hands. He seemed to think
that this Union would last forever, or if it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
should be divided, the Alleghenies would
be the line of separation. In this opinion I
heartily coincided with him. He was quite
cheerful, and very agreeable in conversation.
He appeared to know his position—who
his friends were around him, and who
were not his friends. At that time I thought
he had more friends among his officers than
he supposed he had, but subsequently I ascertained
the entire correctness of his information
on that matter. He has doubtless
been very unfortunate. Placed in his high
station as unexpectedly to himself as to a
whole nation, his first cabinet was not of
his selection, and they deserted him in a
critical moment. He was compelled instantly
to form a new cabinet, which unfortunately
for him, Upshur always excepted,
began forthwith to help themselves, and
their poor, needy, greedy dependants, and
they have continued to help themselves
ever since they have been in office. Two
of these heads of department spent their
time in studying how they might gratify<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
either their cupidity or their malice. The
indignation of all honest men in the nation
was roused into activity against the President,
on account of removals from office on
several occasions, because they argued that
the Chief Magistrate, unless he approved of
such flagrant acts of oppression, in removing
from office such men as Gen. Van Rensellaer,
Governor Lincoln, and a long list of
good men, he would at once remove those
heads of department who had been guilty
of such high-handed injustice. Thus, the
whole blame fell on the President, instead
of falling on the real authors of such wickedness.
The President has been, and is
still blamed, for many appointments of very
incompetent men, which I understood him
to say, he never had interfered with at all.
So of the accounting officers, who had in
many cases, it is said, done great injustice
to individuals, and then had charged all
their enormities on the President. The
people in every part of the Union had become
exasperated at these flagrant acts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
oppression and injustice. Claimants, where
the case was as clear as the noon-day, were
postponed from day to day, for weeks and
months; their claims were to be acted on,
none could say when. It is a fashion they
have here, of putting off the settlement of
claims until the applicant has spent here
about all that he gets from the government.
The supernumerary officers, block up every
avenue to the treasury. Congress should
either dismiss them altogether, or send
them off to clear out our western rivers, or
employ them as far off as possible from the
seat of the national government. Why they
are here at all is a mystery to me, and why
Congress permits them to throng their lobbies
and the rotundo, is equally surprising
to me. West Point academy was once useful,
but if the cadets are to accumulate as
rapidly as they have of late years, it may
lead in the end to an aristocracy in this
country. Whether this institution, on the
whole, is an useful one, is at best quite
doubtful in my mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Taking a recess, as a legislator would call
it, I here say that Washington city and its
surrounding country is delightfully situated
for the seat of the national government.—The
ground rising gradually from the water
and extending back in places a mile or
more, with the space occupied by water,
between, the ground around it on all sides
of it, presents every variety of aspect, almost,
calculated to render it pleasant as a
residence. It has none of the bustle of
commerce, none of its noise or crowd. During
a session of Congress, persons of both
sexes are in the city from all parts of the
Union, with whom the stranger can associate,
and obtain a great deal of information,
topographical, literary, scientific, general
or particular. Every person in the
whole Union being here represented, one
can gain correct information concerning
any man of any note in the nation. By going
to the library room of Congress, he can
there find and read almost any books which
he desires to consult. He can there see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
daily, persons of the most refined taste, polite
manners and agreeable conversation.
None but such persons are rarely seen in
that room. I have always found reading
people more placid and more agreeable in
their manners than others, and were any
whole nation wholly composed of such materials,
it would be the happiest and the
best nation in the world. Mr. John S.
Meehan the librarian and Edward B. Stelle,
C. H. W. Meehan and Robert Kearon,
his assistants, are among the most polite
and agreeable gentlemen in this city. They
are always ready to attend to the wishes
of all who call on them. Personally acquainted
with nearly all who call at their
room, they are always ready to introduce
a stranger to any gentleman who is in the
room. Fatigued as they sometimes are
with the constant labor of a long day, yet
they never complain of their toil, but cheerfully
attend to all the wants of the visiters.—This
room is opened very early in the
morning, and not closed until a late hour.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
If any officers of the government deserve
all their salaries, and more too, they are
the Meehans, father and son, Stelle and
Kearon. Their salaries are small ones, and
their labors are great and fatiguing all day
long, during the whole session of Congress.
During the intervals between the sessions,
their labors are not so fatiguing, but they
are even then constant, unremitting and
useful to the visiters, who are always all
day long in this library. Having known
these gentlemen fourteen years and upwards
in their present stations, I take a
real pleasure in bearing this testimony in
their favor.</p>

<p>How many messengers, assistant messengers,
doorkeepers and assistant doorkeepers,
clerks and assistant clerks, postmasters
and assistant postmasters, paperfolders, pages,
&amp;c. &amp;c. there are here, I cannot tell,
because I do not know, but their numbers
must be very large, and they cost the nation
a great deal. All the officers of government
in the city must amount to one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
thousand at least, and their salaries would
support probably all the State governments
in the Mississippi Valley. I make no complaint
of this vast expense, but we must
not find fault with the expenses of monarchical
government in many of the minor
governments in the old world. Take from
those governments, in the north of Europe,
their standing armies, rendered necessary,
perhaps, by their peculiar position, and it is
possible that their governments might be
cheaper than ours. That we have many
useless officers, many members of Congress
seem to think, but whether they can be
cast off, because they are useless, is doubtful.
This army of smaller officers are always
on the alert, when retrenchment and
reform are talked of by members—these
creatures crying out: “penny wise and
pound foolish.” They have some influence
on Congress, and would be glad to have
more. So far as the House of Representatives
are concerned, there is a strong disposition
to reduce the expenses of the government,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
but the Senate has not yet acted
finally on that subject.</p>

<p>Very soon after my return to Washington,
I became personally acquainted with
Judge Upshur, Secretary of State. From
the first day I saw and conversed with him
in his office, until the day of his death, I
saw him at least once, often twice a day,
and wrote down at night what had been
the subjects of our conversation in our interview.
I did this at his suggestion, so
that he could duly consider the subject
matter of our discourse in the day time.
He was one of the most agreeable, sensible
and truly good men, whom I ever became
personally acquainted with. Sometimes he
has been called a nullifier, perhaps, but no
man in the nation was ever more attached
to the Union than he was. We thought
precisely alike on that subject—that it is
the highest duty of all our citizens to use
all the means in our power to promote the
interests of all sections of the Union, and of
all classes of its people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
The natural cements of our confederacy,
consisting of mutual interests promoted by
mutual acts of kindness and affection for
each other, Judge Upshur preferred, as he
often told me, to all or even any resorts to
the violent restraints of physical force, such
as the despot and the tyrant employ. He
dwelt with rapture on the future prospects
of this nation, when its citizens and its institutions,
would cover the whole of North
America, like a mantle, and when our ships
would float on every sea and visit every
island and country in the world. When
our steamers would ascend and descend
every river of any size that irrigates the
countries of both continents. By such
means, he thought, christianity would be
spread from pole to pole, and all the world
become united in the bonds of peace, harmony
and brotherly affection. In this way,
wars would cease and the despot and the
warrior be laid aside as useless. “The nodding
plume, he said, dyed in blood, would
no more be seen.” Knowing as I did, all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
his views and all his plans, and the means
which he would have used to carry them
into execution, I felt the overwhelming calamity
of his death the more on these accounts.
His plans were all formed, and
they were just about to be carried into effect,
otherwise he would have instantly
gone into private life. Laying my own feelings,
as to myself, out of the question, and
looking only to the public interest, I felt
myself and the country overwhelmed by an
awful calamity. Any successor of Judge
Upshur would not have the time, such as
he had devoted to that object, to form and
mature plans of operation. And if he had
such plans laid as Upshur had, his successor
might not have the necessary means of
effecting his object. As a nation, we deserved
to suffer, but still we may mourn for
our dreadful loss, sustained by his untimely
death.</p>

<p>Judge Upshur was a man of good principles
and pure morals. He was all in reality
and truth, that any old Virginia gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
was in the days of Washington, Jefferson,
Madison and Monroe, an ornament to
human nature itself and of the “Ancient
Dominion.” He recalled to my mind the
old patriots of Virginia, for whom from my
earliest years I had entertained a strong
and abiding sense of their worth, their intrinsic
value, as men and as citizens of this
republic. From three of their Presidents I
had received numerous marks of their confidence
in me and my relatives. This may
be one reason almost without my knowing
it why I have always taken such pleasure in
doing justice to Virginia’s favorite sons. I
shall always take a melancholy pleasure in
remembering Judge Upshur, and in associating
him in my mind with my old friend
Chief Justice Marshall. From the latter
gentleman I received a great deal of aid
in the way of information, while I was in
Washington, many years since, when I was
preparing for the press my History of Ohio.
An old Virginia gentleman, as he exists in
my recollections of Jefferson, Marshall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Monroe and Upshur—the Randolphs, the
Masons, the Lees, the Pendletons—and
what I hear of Archer, Rives and others is as
perfect as human nature can be.</p>

<p>Here I present a very condensed account
of the awful calamity on board the Princeton
on the 28th day of February, 1844.—The
first announcement of the event is derived
from the Intelligencer of the 29th of
February, and the account of the funeral
obsequies is extracted from the Globe of
the 4th of March.</p>

<p>In the whole course of our lives it has
never fallen to our lot to announce to our
readers a more shocking calamity—shocking
in all its circumstances and concomitants—than
that which occurred on board
the United States ship Princeton, yesterday
afternoon, whilst under way, in the river
Potomac, fourteen or fifteen miles below
the city. Yesterday was a day appointed
by the courtesy and hospitality of Captain
Stockton, Commander of the Princeton, for
receiving as visiters to his fine ship (lying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
off Alexandria) a great number of guests,
with their families, liberally and numerously
invited to spend the day on board. The
day was most favorable, and the company
was large and brilliant, of both sexes; not
less probably in number than four hundred,
among whom were the President of the
United States, the Heads of the several
Departments, and their families. At a proper
hour, after the arrival of the expected
guests, the vessel got under way and proceeded
down the river, to some distance
below Fort Washington. During the passage
down, one of the large guns on board
(carrying a ball of 225 pounds) was fired
more than once, exhibiting the great power
and capacity of that formidable weapon of
war. The ladies had partaken of a sumptuous
repast; the gentlemen had succeeded
them at the table, and some of them had
left it; the vessel was on her return up the
river, opposite to the fort, where Captain
Stockton consented to fire another shot
from the same gun, around and near which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
to observe its effects, many persons had
gathered, though by no means so many as
on similar discharges in the morning, the
ladies who then thronged the deck being
on this fatal occasion almost all between
decks, and out of reach of harm.</p>

<p>The gun was fired. The explosion was
followed, before the smoke cleared away
so as to observe its effect, by shrieks of wo
which announced a dire calamity. The
gun had burst, at a point three or four feet
from the breech, and scattered death and
desolation around. Mr. <span class="smcap">Upshur</span>, Secretary
of State, Mr. <span class="smcap">Gilmer</span>, so recently placed at
the head of the Navy, Commodore <span class="smcap">Kennon</span>,
one of its gallant officers, <span class="smcap">Virgil Maxcy</span>,
lately returned from a diplomatic residence
at the Hague, Mr. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>, of New York,
(formerly a member of the Senate of that
State,) were among the slain. Besides
these, seventeen seamen were wounded,
several of them badly and probably mortally.
Among those stunned by the concussion,
we learn not all seriously injured,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
were Capt. Stockton himself; Col. Benton,
of the Senate; Lieut. Hunt, of the Princeton;
W. D. Robinson, of Georgetown.—Other
persons also were perhaps more or
less injured, of whom in the horror and confusion
of the moment, no certain account
could be obtained. The above are believed
to comprise the whole of the persons known
to the public who were killed or dangerously
or seriously hurt.</p>

<p>The scene upon the deck may more easily
be imagined than described. Nor can
the imagination picture to itself the half of
its horrors. Wives, widowed in an instant
by the murderous blast! Daughters smitten
with the heart-rending sight of their
father’s lifeless corpse! The wailings of
agonized females! The piteous grief of the
unhurt but heart-stricken spectators! The
wounded seamen borne down below! The
silent tears and quivering lips of their brave
and honest comrades, who tried in vain to
subdue or to conceal their feelings! What
<em>words</em> can adequately depict a scene like
this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
On Saturday the last rites were paid to
the distinguished men who laid down their
lives on the deck of the Princeton. The
funeral procession presented the most sad,
solemn, affecting scene ever witnessed in
this city of the Union. The President’s
House was again—as on the demise of
General Harrison—made the receptacle of
death. Instead of one, five bodies were
now laid out in the lately illuminated east
room of that fair mansion, which before the
melancholy fate which there awaited General
Harrison in the first month of the first
year of his presidential term, had never
known a pall within its precincts. The
first month of the last year of the same term
found it again turned almost into a charnel
house. Like “<i>the Capets monument</i>,” it became
“<em>a palace of dim night</em>,” and gathered
within its gloom the blackened and bloody
remains of a most frightful tragedy—the
bodies of five intimate friends of the President,
two of them his cabinet associates, all
hurried out of existence while he sat unconsciously,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
with only a plank between
them, enjoying a song. What a thin partition
in this life separates its scenes of
greatest enjoyment and bitterest grief!!</p>

<p>Religious rites were performed over the
dead by the Rev. Mr. Hawley and Mr. Butler,
of the Episcopal Church, and Mr. Laurie,
of the Presbyterian Church, before leaving
the President’s House. The bodies
were then hearsed, and the procession led
off by the military companies, which filled
the avenue in front of the President’s house.
The military array, composed of horse, infantry,
and artillery, made a very imposing
appearance; and the train of carriages
which followed extended along the avenue
more than a mile. A vast multitude, on
foot and on horseback, from the neighboring
cities and adjoining country, filled the
spaces not occupied by the procession. The
whole distance between the President’s and
the Capitol square, as far as the vision could
reach through the darkness of the day and
the dust, seemed to be a living current, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
slow movement to the wailing and mournful
music of the band, which, with the sound
of distant cannon and solemn-pealing bells,
alone broke the silence. The immense
crowd was perfectly mute in its march.
The dread quiet that reigned over all; the
almost twilight darkness that dimmed the
whole day; the deep mists that shadowed
the surrounding hills and horizon from sight;
the cloud of dust that covered the long and
gloomy procession; the sweeping trains of
crape that blackened the closed windows
and doors of the dwellings on the way,—gave,
altogether, the most saddened and
impressive aspect of wo ever worn by this
city. It was rendered the more deeply affecting
by the contrast of but a few days
before, when the warmth of a vernal sun
had shone out, giving light and gayety to
our streets, opening the buds upon the trees
and bringing out the tender green upon the
grounds whereon the snow had so recently
lain.</p>

<p>The mournful ceremonials had just been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
concluded, when the city was alarmed with
the apprehension of another fatal accident
to the Chief Magistrate himself. As he returned
in his carriage of state from the place
of interment, (the Congress burying ground,
about three miles from the President’s
House,) his horses took fright, and ran with
fury along the great thoroughfare, filled
with people and carriages. There was no
arresting their wild career; the reins were
broken in the attempt to restrain them, and
all that could be done was to give room to
their headlong flight. As they approached
the turn in the end of the avenue, obstructed
by the President’s square, they got
scared at something on one side of the
street, and shied off in their course to the
curb-stone on the other side, which gave
the advantage to an intrepid colored man
on the side walk to seize them by the short
reins and stop them. A little beyond, in
the direction they were going, lay masses
of the large stone rejected from the new
treasury building, near the precipitous bank<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
to the south of the President’s wall. Had
not the career of the horses been arrested
at the moment that it was, the next would
have wrecked the carriage on these rocks,
or precipitated it over the bank. The President
was happy to escape from his state
equipage, over which all guidance and control
was lost, and find himself afoot, by the
side of his humble deliverer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Dana’s speech against the military Academy.—Objections—it is an aristocratic
institution.—1st in its selection of candidates—2nd in its monopoly
of military commissions.—Its expenses are enormous and wholly
disproportioned to any advantages to be derived from it.—Its positive
evils, as it operates on the officers and on the private soldiers.—Mr.
Dana might have added, that if this republic is in danger from any quarter,
its danger lies in this institution.</p></blockquote>

<p>Immediately after the funeral obsequies,
Congress took up, on the 6th of March, the
bill making appropriations for the Military
Academy at West Point. Mr. <span class="smcap">Hale</span> of New
Hampshire, one of the best debaters in the
House, moved to strike out the appropriation
from the bill. On this occasion, Mr.
Dana of New York delivered a powerful
speech in favor of the motion. The intrinsic
value of this speech entitles it to a place
in our book, so that its home truths may be
duly considered by all who read books or
public documents. The institution itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
should be given away to the regents of the
University of New York, or to some literary
institution, and no longer be connected
with the general government. But we proceed
to lay before the reader extracts from
this elegant speech.</p>

<p>Mr. Dana said: My first objection to the
academy is, that it is <em>an aristocratic institution</em>.
It is aristocratic in its <em>nature and character</em>.
It gives to a few individuals privileges
which it denies to the many. Out of
a population of eighteen or twenty millions,
about one hundred individuals are annually
selected as the exclusive recipients of the
national bounty, and are paid and educated
at the public expense, without making the
least return for the benefits they receive.
All other persons who draw pay or salaries
from the government, perform services of
some kind—often perhaps very inadequate
but the cadets do nothing for the public;
make no return whatever. Their pay and
education are mere gratuities. Is it just,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
or right, or republican, thus to pamper a
few at the expense of the community?</p>

<p>The institution is aristocratic in the manner
of <em>selecting the cadets</em>. They are nominated
and virtually appointed by members
of Congress. The privilege of appointing a
cadet has become an appendage of a seat in
this House. A member is thus enabled, at
the public expense, to provide for a relative,
dependant, or favorite, by quartering
him for life upon the treasury. He thus enjoys
a patronage almost equal to his pay.
Why should he have this extra privilege?
Are not members sufficiently compensated
for their services? If not, increase their
pay; but do not suffer them to quarter their
dependants upon the public. Such a privilege
will be abused; it cannot exist without
abuse. It is not only unjust to the community,
but it is injurious to this House.
Congress is called upon to legislate continually
in relation to the academy; and will
not such a patronage tend unconsciously to
bias the judgment of members, however<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
pure their intentions? It is not in the nature
of man to be entirely impartial and indifferent
when his own interests are involved.
But even if he succeeds in divesting
himself of every improper influence, and
acts with the strictest justice and propriety,
his country’s good his only object, he will
be likely to gain little credit by it; he will
still be suspected. Men incapable of acting
with the like nobleness themselves will
be slow to believe it of others. I do not
doubt that every member will act on this
subject from the purest motives; but if we
would stand well with the country—if we
would have full credit for disinterestedness
with the people, we ought to divest ourselves
of this patronage.</p>

<p>Again, sir, if this power be confined without
check or control to members of Congress,
will there not be danger of the institution
being aristocratic in the <em>persons</em> selected
as cadets? Whom will a member
be most likely to nominate? Will it not
be a son or relative, or some one dependent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
for support upon the member?—or, if
there happens to be none such, the son or
friend of some wealthy or influential constituent
whose influence the member desires
to secure? I would rejoice to find it
otherwise. But when we examine the roll
of cadets, and compare it with the lists of
members of Congress, we find such a coincidence
of names as I cannot attribute
wholly to accident; there must have been
some relationship between them to produce
such a striking family likeness.</p>

<p>[Mr. Giddings. I wish to state a fact for
the information of the gentleman. Some
years ago, being applied to to nominate a
cadet for my district, and having at that
time a son of the proper age to enter the
academy, I wrote to many of the prominent
men of my district to send me the name of
a candidate, and could not procure one.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dana</span>. The district of the gentleman
from Ohio appears to a be very peculiar one
in many respects. Unless I am greatly mistaken,
relatives and connexions of many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
men of wealth and high stations have been
educated at the public expense at West
Point, and the privilege has been highly
coveted and eagerly sought by them generally,
the single instance of the constituents
of the gentleman from Ohio to the contrary
notwithstanding. I am entirely opposed
to the whole system of educating any
person, or class of persons, at the public expense;
but if some must be so educated,
let them be selected for their merits—for
their talents and virtues; give the preference
to the poor and to the orphan—they
are the most needy and deserving—instead
of bestowing the national bounty on the
rich and influential, who have other means
of education. I admit there have been many
instances in which members, waiving all
selfish considerations, (and I honor them for
it,) have selected the most meritorious candidate;
but as a general rule, in this contest
for patronage between wealth and
power on the one side, and poverty on the
other, it needs not the gift of prophesy to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
determine which will triumph. If this Academy
shall be continued, I hope that, at
least, its organization will be so changed as
to secure to the poor a fair participation in
its benefits.</p>

<p>The institution is aristocratic in the <em>monopoly
of military commissions</em> which it secures
to the cadets after they have received
their education. It is not sufficient to educate
them at the public expense, but they
must also be provided for in the same way
ever after, and that too in the most objectionable
form of a monopoly. No man,
whatever may be his talents or qualifications,
or his thirst for military fame, can get
into the army unless he enter through the
gate of the West Point Academy, the only
portal open to ambition. Thus every person
who has passed the age of 21, without
obtaining an appointment in the academy,
and every person under 21 who does not
graduate there, is disfranchised, and rendered
incapable of holding a commission.
He may have spent his days in toil, and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
nights in study, to qualify himself for his
country’s service; he may have mastered
all military science; the fire of genius may
burn bright in his soul; he may be impelled
by the purest patriotism, and be the “bravest
of the brave;” but he comes not
through the door of privilege—he has never
graduated at West Point—he is rejected!
Is this the equality of your boasted institutions?
If “all men are created equal,” that
equality is soon lost by congressional legislation.
It is said that military science is
necessary in the army, and that there is no
institution except at West Point where it
is taught. How can it be taught elsewhere?
The science acquired any where but at
West Point is of no value to the possessor.
Abolish the monopoly of military commissions,
throw them open for competition to
merit and science, wherever acquired, and
there will be places enough for instruction
in the art, without burdening the treasury,
and a much wider range for the selection of
officers will be afforded to you. West Point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
is a beautiful and healthy place, and a
strong military position; but there is nothing
in its air or climate, however salubrious,
that in itself creates a soldier. It has the
monopoly of commissions—not of qualifications—the
same instruction at another location
would have equal effect in qualifying
an officer to command. I object to the institution,
because it is aristocratic, also, in
the <em>habits and feelings</em> which it inculcates.
Petted as the cadets are, it would be surprising
if they did not become proud and vain.
It is not their fault—your laws make them
so. They are placed in such a position as
to render the adoption of such feelings almost
inevitable. They alone have a public
education at the expense of the nation.
They are instructed in things which no
other individuals have any motives for learning—they
only are deemed legally competent
for officers of the army; and they naturally
reason: “If our services were not
indispensable, we should not be educated at
the public expense. If persons not educated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
at West Point were capable of performing
the duties of military commanders, we
would not be allowed to monopolize military
commissions. If the knowledge we
have obtained could be had elsewhere, the
United States would not, at great expense,
erect and maintain the military academy.
If our country could dispense with us, we
should not be commissioned and retained
for years under pay without employment.
We alone have been educated for officers.
All the military science of the nation centres
in us; no others are qualified to command.
We are a caste by ourselves—a military nobility,
on whom the fortunes of the country
depend.” Censure not these young men for
their opinions. They are the legitimate
fruits of your legislation—fair and just inferences
from your enactments. But they
are not, therefore, the less to be regretted.
Such enactments are calculated to draw a
wide line of separation between the cadets
and their fellow citizens; to foster a spirit
of pride and arrogance, and self-sufficiency,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
on the part of the former, mixed with scorn
and contempt of the multitude, to be returned
by the latter with feelings of envy
and detestation. Have not these consequences
resulted? Does not, even now, an ill
feeling exist between West Point and the
country?</p>

<p>My next objection to the academy is, that
the expenses are exorbitant, and greatly
disproportioned to the benefits.</p>

<p>A report made by the Secretary of War
at the present session of Congress, states the
expenditures to have been upwards of four
million of dollars. Over seven hundred
thousand dollars of that sum is the cost of
the grounds, buildings and fixtures, in the
nature of capital, which cannot be considered
as entirely wasted, though they are
of little value in any other respect than as
connected with this institution. The residue
amounting to 3,291,500 dollars, is stated as
the current expenses of the institution—the
cost of educating the cadets. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
would amount to an annual expenditure of
about 130,000 dollars. The number of cadets
who have graduated, including those
who are expected to graduate on the 30th
of June next, amounts only to 1,231; each
graduate, therefore, has occasioned an expense
to the nation of three thousand two
hundred and fifty dollars; or, if we take
only the current expenses, deducting what
may be considered as an investment of capital,
the cost of each amounts to 2,673 dollars.
But the amount thus reported by the
Secretary of War, I understand, includes
only the direct and immediate expenditures
for the institution, and omits many expenses
which the academy has indirectly occasioned.
A friend who has carefully investigated
the matter, and whose general accuracy
I cannot doubt, makes the cost of
each cadet who graduates this year amount
to five thousand dollars. All of the expenditures
direct and indirect, by reason of the
military academy, I have no doubt, exceed
five millions of dollars, which is the cost of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
educating 1,231 persons in military science
sufficiently to qualify them for subaltern officers
in the army. A part of them have
taken their commissions, and are employed
in the public service. Some have declined
to accept, others have resigned soon after
their acceptance, while many have received
commissions, and been placed on the roll
of supernumeraries—officers without men
to command, or military duties to perform.
Those who have graduated are by no means
all who have entered the academy. Since
1815 the whole number of students has
been 2,942. Deducting the 1,231 who
have graduated, and are expected to graduate
at the close of the present year, and
there will remain 1,711 who have not graduated.
Less than 200 remain at the academy,
and between 1,500 and 1,600 must
have left it without completing their education,
or rendering any equivalent to the
nation for the expense incurred for them.
Perhaps, however, it is not a subject of regret
that so many of the cadets have left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the institution, or been dismissed from it
without completing their education, and
claiming their privilege of military commissions,
as many more yet remain than we
have the means of employing. The number
of cadets at the academy usually
amounts to about 250—the number annually
admitted to about 100, of whom about
40 graduate. The army absorbs 22, and
the remaining 18 are supernumeraries, holding
brevet commissions, without active duties.
It is rather a subject of congratulation,
therefore, than of regret, that 60 out
of a hundred of the students do not so persevere
unto the end as to entitle themselves
to commissions, and become quartered for
life upon the treasury; but it is not on this
account less objectionable in principle thus
to educate them at the public expense, without
an equivalent, in service or otherwise.
A law providing, in terms, that 100 students
should be admitted annually into the academy,
and educated at the public expense—that
40 of them should be retained as officers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of the army, and the remainder be
discharged from all claims for the instruction
they receive, and the expense they occasion,
would be denounced as unjust and
unconstitutional; but a law effecting indirectly
precisely the same objects, receives
not only the sanction, but the eulogies of
the most strict constructionists. What cannot
constitutionally be done directly, may
be accomplished indirectly, without trenching
upon the constitution. Be it so. I shall
not raise a constitutional question here.
My observation has taught me that the
constitution is formed of materials very like
India-rubber. It will stretch on the one
side so as to admit anything a man desires
to introduce, and close so tight on the other
as to shut out everything he wishes to exclude.</p>

<p>But to return to the question. I hold it
to be a less evil to give the supernumerary
cadets a gratuitous education, if the nation
can be thereafter discharged from their support,
than to retain them as officers of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
army, when their services are not wanted.
Already the supernumeraries, at the lowest
estimate, amount to seventy, whose support
and pay cost the nation nearly 70,000 dollars
a year; and the number will be largely
increased at the next examination, which
occurs in June. Prior to the Florida war,
the number of unemployed officers was
much greater; but, at its commencement,
resignations were “plenty as blackberries.”
It is but justice, however, to those who retained
their commissions, to say, that they
fought gallantly and well in the most unpromising
and disagreeable contest.</p>

<p>Not only is the military academy an aristocratic
and expensive institution, but it is
also the parent of some <em>positive evils</em>. The
first that I shall notice is the jealousies and
controversies which it occasions between
the officers of the army. Some of the officers
have been educated at West Point,
others have not. Most of the superior officers
have not enjoyed the advantages of
that institution: nearly all of the inferior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
officers have. Thus they are divided into
two classes—the regular and the irregular.
The cadets, having enjoyed greater advantages
than their superiors—served a regular
apprenticeship to their business, and entered
the service by the only door the law
now recognises—can hardly fail to look
upon their superiors as unlearned, as mere
intruders, the creatures of accident, as usurper
of stations of right belonging to themselves.
Is it possible for such feelings to
remain smothered for years in the bosom,
like the hidden fire of a volcano, without
occasional eruptions? Will not such sentiments
be very apt to break out in overt acts
of disrespect and contempt? And will not
the older officers, annoyed and disgusted by
what they deem the vanity and presumption
of the juniors, be likely to meet this
spirit by a haughty and imperious bearing,
calculated and intended to mortify their
pride, and check their assumptions? Have
not the many quarrels and controversies, often
ending in courts of inquiry and courts-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>martial,
which have been so frequent in,
and so disgraceful to the army, originated
principally in these conflicting sentiments?
Sir, I apprehend the difficulties have been
so produced, and under the same circumstances
they will continue to occur, while
human nature remains unchanged. Harmony
can no more be expected to exist between
two distinct classes of officers, so
differently taught and appointed, than between
different sets of children in the same
family, whom all experience has shown to
be irreconcilable.</p>

<p>The second positive evil I shall notice, is
the effect produced upon the soldiery. By
means of the Military Academy, the door
to promotion is effectually closed against
the men; the cadets having the exclusive
right to preferment, and there being already
seventy supernumerary officers and the
number annually increasing. The soldier,
thus excluded from promotion, has no incentive
to bravery or good conduct; all he
has to desire is to shirk danger and hardship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
as much as he can, without incurring
the risk of punishment. Does not this state
of things necessarily degrade and demoralize
the army? Who would enlist into such
a service? None but the desperate and the
vicious. Having no hopes, they can be influenced
only by their fears—the ties which
should unite them to their leaders are all
broken, and their obedience, instead of the
submission of respect or affection, becomes
the base servility of apprehension, and a
desire to escape bodily suffering. The officers
can regard such men as little better
than brutes, to be controlled by fear and
force, while the men look upon their officers
as tyrants, to whom they are compelled
to yield an unwilling obedience. What motive
or feeling in the soldier can be appealed
to as incentive to good conduct? Ambition,
hope, pride? All are crushed and blighted.
Conscience? Its voice is powerless with
such men. Fear alone remains—the fear of
personal suffering; and to this the officers
appeal. Hence, despite your laws, corporal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
punishment has been, and continues to
be, and, I fear, will continue to be, inflicted.
True, it is prohibited; but has the prohibition
banished it from the army? No; nor
can it, until you so change the organization
that the soldier will have other motives of
action besides a fear of punishment. A late
court-martial has exemplified the operation
of these feelings in the army. A soldier
who had been committed to the guard-house
for some misconduct, was brought out by
an officer and severely beaten with a sword.
The officer was arraigned before a court-martial
for unofficer-like conduct in thus
beating the soldier in violation of law and
of the rules and articles of war; and the
court-martial, although they found that the
act was committed as charged, decided that
no criminality was attached thereto, and
honorably acquitted the accused. When
the proceedings were reported to the commanding
general, he disapproved of the decision,
and ordered the court-martial to reassemble
to consider the case, and demanded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
of the court by what law or order a
soldier could be taken from the guard-house
and beaten with a sword; and if there was
none, that then the accused should be punished
according to law. The court reassembled,
and reaffirmed its decision; and,
the proceedings being reported to the War
Department, were again sent back for recommendation
and reconsideration, and the
decision shown to be entirely erroneous.
But the court-martial refused to change its
decision, and I regret to be obliged to say
that the department tamely submitted.
Now, it may be considered as an established
principle, decided by a court-martial and
acquiesced in by the government, that an
officer may take an unprotected and imprisoned
soldier, beat him with an implement
not more dangerous or cruel than a sword,
without being guilty of “unofficer-like conduct,”
although it be in direct violation of
law, and of the rules and articles of war;
and if the officer be arraigned for misconduct,
he is entitled to an “honorable acquittal.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Perhaps it is necessary, as an act
of justice to other officers, to add that the
accused, and most of the members of the
court were graduates of West Point. Is this
the submission to the laws which is there
inculcated?—the respect for the rights of
inferiors taught at that “<em>democratic institution</em>?”
After all, sir, the fault is as much in
the system as in the men. By excluding
every non-commissioned officer and private
from promotion, you so degrade the army,
and destroy its moral power, that is difficult
to govern it without the infliction of corporal
punishment. Abolish the West Point
monopoly—open the way to merit for promotion
from the ranks—and a new and far
better class of soldiers will enlist in your
service, a new spirit will pervade the army,
obedience will be prompt and willing, emulation
and hope will lead to acts of daring
bravery, and you will gain in efficiency far
more than you lose in science.</p>

<p>The last evil I shall notice is the want of
confidence, respect and attachment between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
the army and the people. The main
reliance of this country for defence is, and
ever must be, the militia. Anything, therefore,
which tends to prejudice the militia,
or the mass of the people, against the army,
should be cautiously avoided, as it is essential
to have them act in concert and harmony.
Whether merited or unmerited, it
cannot be denied that the people, and especially
that portion of them which compose
the militia, look upon West Point, and West
Point officers, with great disfavor; they are
specially unpopular. If war should occur,
and the army and militia be brought in contact,
the most disastrous consequences might
ensue from their dissensions. It would be
difficult, perhaps impossible, to induce the
militia to volunteer their services when
they would be placed under the command
of the cadets. In the objections I have
made, and the views I have taken of West
Point, I believe I have expressed the general
sentiment of the militia of my district,
and of the majority of the State I have the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
honor in part to represent. Located, as the
academy is, in the State of New York, its
character and influences must be as well
known and appreciated there as in any part
of the Union; yet it has been repeatedly
denounced by military conventions, composed
of the most distinguished and enlightened
men of that State. Believing it
to be an expensive, extravagant, and anti-democratic
institution of little use, the occasion
of many controversies between the
officers, and of discontent and degradation
to the soldiers, I cannot give my vote for
its continuance.</p>

<p>This chapter is serious, grave, gay and mysterious.—Good advice to Uncle
Sam.—A dream which clears up the mystery of beards and mustaches,
and accounts for some things, but cannot account for others, until the author

<p>Should that time ever arrive when the
members of our state and national legislatures
practise all the vices which the
laws they make are apparently made to
punish and prevent—what influence can
their legislative acts exert on the community?
Why enact laws to prevent the commission
of acts, which their own examples
encourage and aid, and even induce? If
such legislators are often seen at the card
table, in the race field, or at the nightly debauch,
will not men in less honorable stations
continue to follow such blighting examples?
Unless men in the highest, civil,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
military and naval stations, pay due regard
to the decencies of life, to the strict rules
of morality, will persons in private life and
in humble stations do better than their superiors
in office? Because the rich man
can afford to live in luxury, will not his example
exert a bad influence on the poor,
and on those whose means do not enable
them to live a life of extravagance and
wasteful expenditure? What effect then
have high salaries on this or any other community?
Let any observing man look over
this district, and then answer my question.
We live in an age of innovation—in an age,
when the passions are let loose, and when
the pseudo reformers are busily engaged in
their endeavors to uproot all our old, well-established
forms of government, religion,
morals and law. Like the largest oak on
the Alleghanies, which has withstood the
fury of the elements during five centuries,
we hope our institutions of all sorts may survive
the furious blasts of demagogues in
morals, politics and religion. But if we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
wish these institutions to last, we must stand
by our colors, hanging out our banner on the
outward wall, and manfully defend our fortress
against all the assaults of innovators—of
restless, rash and wicked men. We must
stand to our arms, and dare to meet every
emergency, with blow for blow and gun for
gun. Under the care of such guardians,
liberty, religion and law have little to fear
for the result. I thank God, that there are
a considerable number of such men in this
district, whom I well know and duly appreciate.</p>

<p>These reflections grew out of my associations,
sometimes not voluntary, but from necessity,
where I heard, and was compelled
to hear, every institution in the whole country
assailed by several noisy, ignorant and
self-conceited men, conversing together so
flippantly as to resemble the chatterings of
so many monkeys, and with less good sense
than is possessed by the animals they so
much resembled in their gestures, noise
and frivolity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
During a long session of Congress, as the
first session of each Congress is sometimes
called, assembled here from all parts of the
Union, may be seen true and faithful representatives
of every party, sect, faction and
even fragments of all these parties and factions.
Democrats, whigs, nullifiers, abolitionists,
and all other <em>crats</em>, <em>isms</em> and <em>ists</em>.
They are all busy, all active, sometimes noisy,
boisterous and persevering. Could each
one of them be believed, all the world will
soon come over to their several creeds.
Poor fellows! we suspect that the world
will still roll on in its own orbit, around the
sun, and the puny, tiny insects that are now
buzzing about here, will all pass off and be
gone far away, before dogdays come.</p>

<p>In this Babel, as it is just now, the people
of the district refrain mostly from entering
much into the feelings, interests and
views of the visiters from a distance. The
letter writers, the speculators, office seekers,
and the office suckers, the courtiers and
the courtezans will leave the city when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Congress rises. While Congress sits, all the
crowd will continue to haunt the public
places and the public offices. One would
naturally enough conclude, that in a city,
no larger than this, where some three millions
of dollars are annually expended by
members of Congress and by visiters, money
would be plenty and the citizens would
be all wealthy; but that is not the case.
What becomes of such a vast sum? Shall
I answer my own question? I will answer
it, and confess, that I do not know, and cannot
even imagine what becomes of it. It
disappears from our sight, and those who
have handled the most money, appear to
be in the greatest distress for the means of
paying their just debts! Perhaps there are
exceptions to my general rule, but the exception
proves the general rule to be a correct
one. House rent, being very high, is
assigned as the cause of much distress to
renters. Some of these houses were built
very cheaply, fourteen years since, by the
joint labors of brick makers, brick layers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
joiners and carpenters, who hired their day
laborers at the low price of twelve and a
half cents a day, besides board! So the
day laborers used to tell me, at the time
they were thus employed. Their assertions,
as to their compensation, might have
been untrue, but circumstances satisfied me
at the time, that they told me the truth.
Possibly these day laborers did not work
all day.</p>

<p>In some instances it is possible that quite
too many persons follow some particular
calling, to allow it to be profitable to any
one of that calling. Is the competition too
great? All the nation, I need not say, cannot
live at the seat of the national government.
I should doubt, too, whether all
things being duly considered, this is the
best place in which to rear a family of
children, or one consisting mostly of young
people. More or less dissipation and vice
will always surround the seat of this government.
Move the capitol where we will, the
turkey-buzzards, perhaps the same birds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
will follow it, and build their nests under
the eaves of the treasury building. Their
bills will always be thrust their whole
lengths into Uncle Sam’s purse and Uncle
Sam’s pocket.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Address to Uncle Sam.</span></h3>

<p>“Unfortunate old uncle! you have a great
many lazy, idle, worthless pets, whom you
do wrong, very wrong, to support in idleness,
sloth and dissipation. Are you sure,
Sir, that you are acting the part of a prudent,
discreet and excellent old gentleman,
so long as you indulge such pets in practices
so repugnant to your better nature, in
your earlier years and better days? I do
not expect you to turn them out to grass,
as Nebuchadnezzar was turned out in days
of yore; but certainly, the prairies of Illinois
would afford them a better pasture,
than this sterile district does. Alas! <span class="smcap">Selden’s
refectory</span> is preferred by them, to
all the prairies of the West, blooming with
tall grasses and the most brilliant and beautiful
flowers, and a mint julep to any other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
vegetable. Of all the fowls of the air, some
of them prefer the wing of an ox, whereas
others prefer the oyster to every other bird
of passage! Pray, Sir, be wise in time, put
all your sons into some honest calling,
whereby they may get an honest living and
pay their honest debts, by their industry,
economy and enterprise. Do this forthwith,
or you will become a bankrupt in fame, fortune
and resources and be compelled to take
the benefit of the act for the relief of insolvent
debtors. You own a great many large
houses here, which cost you a great deal of
money, but are there no mortgages on them
which may be foreclosed? That being done,
shall we not soon afterwards see all your
household furniture, your carpets, your tables,
chairs, beds and bedding exposed to
a public sale, on some market morning, opposite
the market-house, on the avenue?—Good
bye, Sir.”</p>

<p>P.S.—A large lot furniture and a great
lottery wheel, from the War office, were
offered for sale at auction the other day on
the avenue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Among the mysteries of this mysterious
city, take the following: Soon after my return
from New York, I went all alone into
the monumental square, east of the capitol,
to discover what a certain low ill-looking
shanty contained. On entering the building,
I saw a statue of <em>Jupiter Tonans</em>, easing
himself, without a shirt on his back, holding
a thunderbolt in his right hand! Every
wrinkle and every feature of his face, and
his Roman dress, without a shirt, and coated
with dust, proved to me at a glance of the
eye, in a moment, that some Italian had
either stolen and brought off the original
statue, or he had exactly copied it; and
that some one had placed it here, for the
purpose of setting up the worship of Jupiter
here at the seat of the national government!
And this in a christian country, in this nineteenth
century! Until I saw this statue
here standing, I did suppose that christianity,
in her onward march, from the banks of
the Jordan to our farthest West, had overthrown
the pagan religion, and had erected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
the cross wherever Jupiter Tonans and his
kindred gods had once stood. After examining
the statue of this heathen deity, I
looked, and behold it stood on a granite
rock, inscribed: “WASHINGTON!” That
Washington was well represented by a
block of granite, I was not prepared either
to affirm or deny, but that any one could
with any sort of propriety introduce into
this square, the worship of Rome’s old pagan
gods, I do deny, and will maintain my
denial on substantial grounds of correct
taste. The old story of Jupiter Tonans, if
my memory serves me, after having read it
forty-four years ago, for the last time, I believe
is this. Some Roman emperor, perhaps
Augustus, was being carried along in
a litter, when one of his bearers was instantly
killed by lightning. The emperor, from
a sense of gratitude to “The Thunderer,”
for sparing his own life, promised to erect,
and finally did erect a temple, dedicated to
“the thundering Jupiter” and placed his
statue in it, in the very act of darting his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
deadly bolt. Who would have thought
that that statue would have been transported
here, and erected for the adoration of the
pagans in this christian country? Paganism
in Washington, in the nineteenth century!
Why not forthwith get up lectures and send
around beggars to crave money in order to
stop its further progress?</p>

<p>To say that Congress ought not to encourage
ingenious foreign artists at all,
would be contrary to our feelings and to all
our history, but our own artists should have
a preference, all other things being equal.
And I do not say, that our artists may not
with great propriety go to Europe and there
study the best labors of the best artists. But
let our Americans carry with them American
hearts, and return to us untinged with
European feelings, and not be imbued either
with the ideas of paganism. Washington
clad in a Roman dress, instead of his
American uniform! Daniel Boone dressed
in a toga, instead of his Western hunting
shirt! An American Indian in a toga, fighting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
a battle in a personal contest, instead
of his being clad in his simple breech clout!
Why such sights are presented to us here,
is a mystery—a mystery of Washington city
which I cannot unfold to the reader. So of
the pedestal of a bust of Mr. Jefferson, resting
on the heads of infants, whose mouths are
wide open, rendered so apparently by the
pressure on the top of their skulls. Whose
absurd taste produced these abortions? To
mingle paganism with the ideas of christianity
in our statues and in our architecture,
is in bad taste, especially in this age. Within
about three hundred years after the
death of the Founder of our religion, against
the superstition of Jews and pagans, against
the ridicule of their wits and the reasonings
of their sages, against the craft of their
politicians, the power of their kings and the
prowess of their armies, against the axe,
the cross and the stake, christianity ascended
the imperial throne, and waved her broad
banner in triumph over the palace of the Cæsars.
Her march and conquests extended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
to every part of the then civilized world.
The idols and all the gods of paganism fell
down prostrate, before the onward march
of christianity, and who will now, set up
these idols <em>here</em>, for the worship of Americans?
Away then with these gods and goddesses—away
with Mercury and his rod,
with Minerva and Venus and Cupid, they
are blemishes, not beauties, they are pagan
and not christian, barbarous and not civilized
signs of the times. We want a Congress
sufficiently christian to overthrow
these idol gods, and all idol worship in the
capitol. The ancient Greeks and Romans
have long since gone down to their graves,
and even their gods have perished from off
the face of the earth. Why dig them up
and bring them here to imbue the minds of
our youth with pagan ideas?</p>

<p>With a view to learn the mystery of wearing
unnatural beards, some filled with vermin,
and some with ginger bread! some resembling
those of Saracens, Turks and
Russians, I visited Lipscomb’s near Gadsby’s,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
on the avenue, and M’Cubbin’s on
Eighth street, and there gravely sat often
for a long time, studying beards and mustaches,
but in vain. At last I came home
to my lodgings at <span class="smcap">Mrs. Tilley’s</span> on Tenth
street, nearly opposite Peter Force’s large
library, and falling asleep in my easy armchair,
a form stood before me in my dream,
with mild aspect a sympathising look, she
thus addressed me: “Let not thy thoughts
about beards and mustaches trouble thee,
because I am sent to reveal to thee the sublime
mysteries of beards and mustaches.
All men are created with certain propensities,
and He who made them, has marked
them, so that their propensities may be
known as soon as the eye sees them. Euruchs
have little or no beards, but a man
whose disposition is Saracenic, Turkish,
Tartarean, Gothic, barbarous or christian,
has given him a beard in accordance with
his natural disposition, But if he is like, in
all respects, a goat, in smell and sensuality,
a goat’s beard is given him and he wears it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
leading about some frail female, dressed in
silk velvet, while his wife with six small
children, and one at the breast is left to
starve at home. Such a man will never
buy or read thy book, otherwise he will
buy it. In compassion to thee, I further inform
thee, that as to beards full of vermin,
that circumstance is owing to the poverty
of their owners, whose purses do not contain
money enough to pay for a comb!
Those beards which contain ginger bread,
it is owing to a fact which is as well known
to me, as it is to this whole city, that many
of the bearded race are so poor, that I have
seen twelve of them contribute a cent a
piece, to purchase a large roll of ginger
bread; they would then tie a cord around
its centre and suspend it to the ceiling over
their heads in the middle of the room, and
seating themselves flat on the floor, in a circle,
and in that position each one of them
would catch a bite, as the ginger bread
was whirled around from mouth to mouth.
And although every mouth was wide open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
like an anaconda’s when swallowing a rabbit,
yet, sometimes the roll struck the beard
and got entangled in it, until the mouth
was filled with the delicious morsel. The
beard itself retained the roll, until some of
the beard stuck to the roll. The fragments
of tobacco in the beard, are to be accounted
for in the same way.” I awoke, refreshed
in body and in mind, having had revealed
to me one of the greatest mysteries of this
city. My mind is now at ease about that
mystery, because I know every man I see
on the avenue, by the beard he wears,
whether he is civilized or savage, rich or
poor. If he is able to get shaved without
running in debt for shaving, he is shaved
clean and smooth. Has he a beard like a
goat’s; his beard proves him to be one that
will stand on the left hand. And so of all
the other signs, they are all revealed to
me, and I, without fee, tell the reader all
about it.</p>

<p>There are other mysteries in this city of
mysteries, which I cannot find out, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
I have slept in my easy armed chair and on
my pillow time and again.</p>

<p>What the Senate will do about the Texan
treaty? whether they will discuss its
merits public or privately? whether they
will stay here, until they have gone through
their long docket of nominations, now before
them? Whether the House will continue
to sit until they complete their business
not yet finally acted on? or whether
they will go home soon, and the people
thereby lose all the benefit of what has
been begun, I cannot divine in this chapter.</p>

family is an ancient one in North Carolina,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
the name being found among the earliest
settlers of that colony. He presides in the
Senate and occupies the Vice President’s
room in the capitol. He is a man above
the common size, of fair complexion and
commanding air, rather grave in his manners,
but very agreeable and appears to be
kind hearted. His voice is clear, sufficiently
loud and distinct to be heard all over the
Senate chamber and its gallery. On the
whole, he is, taking him all and all, the best
presiding officer, that I ever saw in any legislative
assembly. He is always at his
ease, always dignified and always agreeable.
His appearance is that of a man about
forty years old. He is a whig, unwavering
and unflinching, yet, like the Kentucky
Senators, not a persecuting whig, often voting
to confirm men in offices, who are not
whigs, nor any thing else—long. He appears
to look more to the interests of his
country than his party. When I say this,
I mean to draw no invidious distinctions between
Judge Mangum and others in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Senate. The feelings of senators must have
been often severely tried by having presented
to them the names of very incompetent
men. Where the man is not decidedly
a bad one, though wanting <em>decision of
character</em>, without which no man can be relied
on, in any pressing emergency, the
Senate let him pass as Hopson’s choice,
because they expect nothing better. In
this way they have confirmed many nominations
which I should have rejected at
once, as destitute of a qualification, without
possessing which, no man is fit for any office
or any calling. So far as Ohio is concerned,
not even one appointment of a citizen of
that State, has been a good one, nor such
an one as I would have made, during the
last two years. I feel no hostility to any
one of these weak men, but wish they had
belonged to some other State, not to ours.
Where the imbecility of a country is placed
in the offices, it shows the strength of our
institutions and the virtue of our people,
which can get along tolerably well, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
such weak men are appointed to offices.
To have found so much imbecility, so carefully
selected from the very surface of society,
must have cost those a vast deal of labor,
care and diligence, who have succeeded
so well, so perfectly in hunting it up, and
in bringing it forward to the President and
his secretaries for their acceptance and gratification!
It is a strong argument in favor
of the permanency of our institutions, which
can bear such appointments. The Senate
appear to be as hungry for the nomination
of men well qualified for the offices to which
they are nominated, as any trout ever was
for a well baited hook—they jump at them
in a moment and unanimously confirm them.
The confirmation of <span class="smcap">Calhoun’s</span> appointment
as Secretary of State is a case in point. The
news spread like wildfire, and fell upon the
ear like the roar of a water fall in the ear of
a thirsty traveller, in the desert of Sahara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Asbury Dickens</span> is clerk of the Senate,
and a better clerk of that body could not
have been found in the Union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Edward Dyer</span> is sergeant-at-arms, and
he is an excellent officer.</p>

<p>In the House of Representatives, <span class="smcap">John
W. Jones</span> is the speaker. He appears to understand
the rules of the House pretty well,
but owing to the weakness of his voice, or
to the structure of the room, perhaps, we
should attribute something to each cause, I
cannot hear speaker Jones at all, on any occasion,
from any location in the room which
I have ever been permitted to occupy, by
the courtesy of the House.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caleb J. M’Nulty</span> is clerk of this House,
and a better clerk, a more obliging one,
more correct, more industrious, more attentive
to all his duties as a clerk, more obliging,
polite, and in all respects capable and
faithful, never filled the clerk’s office. M.
St. Clair Clarke, his predecessor in office,
although applauded constantly for his good
qualities of all sorts, yet our Ohio man does,
for aught I can see, as well as M. St. Clair
Clarke himself ever did in his best days.</p>

<p>Among the ladies attending on this session<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
of Congress, we mention with pleasure
and pride <span class="smcap">Mrs. M’Nulty</span>, wife of the clerk
of the House. She was born and educated
in Ohio. She is beautiful in form and manners
and does honor to our <em>Buckeye State</em>.</p>

<p>This handsome couple are young in
years, just beginning the world and bid
fair to live long and be useful in the world,
and be ornaments of Ohio. Prosperity and
success to them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Lane</span> of Louisville, Kentucky, is
the sergeant-at-arms in the House, and he
is a very gentlemanly, faithful and attentive
officer.</p>

<p>The door-keeper, <span class="smcap">Jesse E. Dow</span>, and the
postmaster, <span class="smcap">John M. Johnson</span>, are as good
officers as need be, and they give general
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Members of Congress, generally speaking,
are not idle men by any means. Besides
their attendance on the daily sessions
of the two houses, they are on committees,
which occupy no small portion of the day,
and, sometimes they are in their committees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
to a late hour at night. The more laborious
part of the members work more hours,
than any farmer does in the country. Some
of them have a great correspondence with
their constituents and others. They are
obliged to call at the public offices, on the
business of those whom they represent.
Some members, who represent the farmers
of the interior, have little to do, and such
members, are not often chairmen of important
committees, and they may lead an easy
life. Those who represent large cities, or
many commercial people, have more than
they can find time to do it in. The same
remark applies to those who represent manufacturing
districts. Delegates from Territories,
like the Dodges, father and son,
have an immense amount of business to do,
and a great correspondence to carry on.
Such men labor night and day. Calls on
them, made by their constituents and by
others from all parts of the Union, interrupt
them a good deal. General Vance, chairman
of the committee of claims, performs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
daily a very laborious task. So far as Ohio
is concerned, in sending representatives to
both houses, I am sure that we have little
reason to complain of their remissness or inattention
to the duties of their station.
There is not a dissipated man among them
nor an idler. So far as I know, they faithfully
attend to all their business in Congress.
Their per diem, eight dollars, seems
to be a very liberal compensation for their
services, but after paying all their bills for
living here, very little remains. Those
who have families here, actually fall in debt,
and have to borrow money to pay a part of
their expenses. A very considerable number
of the members have their wives with
them—and where they have daughters and
female relatives, their compensation is
wholly inadequate to pay their expenses.
The ladies visit the library often and there
read and amuse themselves, or they sit in
the gallery of the House, listening to the
debates. The families of such members as
are able to bring them here, appear to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
quite happy. By associating with many respectable,
well informed and polite people,
they learn a great deal of the world and its
affairs. They become personally acquainted
with the first men in the nation. In this
way they can form a more correct estimate
of such men, their character, dispositions,
manners, habits and talents. In vain do
we look into newspapers, pamphlets and
periodicals for correct ideas concerning
these men. They are much better, or not
so bad, as common report makes them.
Though I had known Mr. Calhoun forty
years, by common report, and, although I
had seen him often presiding in the Senate
chamber, yet until I sat down beside him
in his office, and had conversed with him
sometime, I had never had any correct ideas
of the man at all. I had always been told,
that he was impetuous, sour and morose,
but I found him to be the mildest, kindest
and most agreeable man I ever saw. I was
truly astonished at the contrast between
the man as he really was, and the one he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
was represented to be! I was agreeably disappointed
in many others. With the character
of our western men I was in no case
deceived, because I knew them either personally
or from correct sources of information.
For instance, although I had never
seen the Kentucky senators, yet I found
them, Crittenden and Morehead, as agreeable,
as well informed, as friendly, kind and
conciliating in their manners, as I had always
understood they were.</p>

<p>By mingling in such society, our young
men may acquire a fund of information,
which may be of great value to them in after
life.</p>

<p>Though I knew Colonel Benton personally
well and knew him to be a man of
kind feelings towards his friends, and even
towards many who are not friendly to him,
yet, he is often represented as malignant
and overbearing. It is not true, because at
the bottom of his heart there is a great deal
of good feeling. He cannot always suppress
the exhibition of his better nature, even towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
open and avowed political opponents.
So of our senators, Tappan and Allen, the
whigs of Ohio believe that these senators
are their enemies, but I always found them
very friendly to me, doing me many favors
and no injury—quite the reverse. They
have their own political creed, differing
from mine in some respects, but they endeavor
to serve their constituents when
they come here, even if they are whigs.</p>

<p>Those who have been long in Congress
can be much more useful to their constituents,
than those who have had less experience.
Understanding all the rules of proceeding,
they know how to take advantage
of circumstances, when to make a motion,
and the exact moment when to oppose an
opponent. They say less and more to the
purpose. Young men are quite apt to be
impetuous, hasty and rash, and thus often
get overwhelmed by a more cool, deliberate
member. <span class="smcap">John Quincy Adams</span> is the
hardest man to deal with in the House.
Understanding all the rules of legislation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
with a large store of information, he is sometimes
sarcastic and witty, sometimes profound
and those who attack him always
come off second best. Of all the attacks
on Mr. Adams this session, C. J. Ingersoll’s
was the most unfortunate for the assailant.
Mr. Wise related the whole of it to me in
the library, immediately after the assault
was made and the chastisement which Ingersoll
got. Mr. Wise condemned C. J.
Ingersoll, as every one else did, for his behaviour
towards an aged, respectable man,
whose public services, years learning and
talents ought to command and do command
the respect of all good men in the nation.
Any member of Congress who respects himself,
will always be treated with respect,
because he deserves it. Any young man,
who thinks to obtain any advantage by assailing
Mr. Adams, will find himself to have
made a false calculation.</p>

<p>The Senators preserve their own dignity,
and do not mingle much with the turbulence
around them. They are often misrepresented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
by malignant letter writers,
and the falsehoods they invent, have a wide
circulation. These Senators cannot devote
up their time to explanations and contradictions
of such misrepresentations. They
have something else to do.</p>

<p>I will state an instance in point. About
the time that the speculators in Texan land
scrip, began their operations, to effect an
annexation of Texas to this Union, some
letter writer pretended to tell exactly how
all the Senators would vote on that question.
A number of the members of that
body told me, “that they had neither made
up nor expressed any opinion on that subject.”
I afterwards ascertained from the
highest source of information, that not a few
Senators would not vote as the speculators
had predicted they would, but exactly the
reverse. Such miscalculations are daily
made by interested or malicious persons,
who hover around the capitol. Seeing the
papers from a distance, and conversing with
the members on the subjects treated of by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
the letter writers, induced me finally to
distrust all I saw, coming from such a polluted
source. These falsehoods do their
authors no good, but often an injury. Placed
as members of Congress are on a pinnacle,
in view of a whole nation, unless they possess
well ballanced minds, they are not to
be envied. They have rivals at home, sometimes
ready to misrepresent their motives,
their services and their talents. There is
always requisite, the constant exercise of
one virtue, at least, which is patience, and
they must labor incessantly to gratify friends
at home, who expect at their hands more
than they can do for them. To be a member
of Congress, requires talents of all sorts—great
industry, great attention to business,
constant care, strength of body and
strength of mind. Members of Congress,
who make a figure as orators, can do little
indeed for individuals among their friends.
Moving in a higher sphere, they aim at some
high station—to be a minister abroad, a Secretary,
or to obtain some lucrative office.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Apparently laboring for the public good,
their real object is frequently very selfish.
Such men have rivals among their own party,
and all their political opponents are opposed
to them. If they succeed to their
hearts’ content, how long does their prosperity
last? In a few short years their race
is run and they are seldom mentioned, but
oblivion covers them from our view and
even from our thoughts. Those who figured
on the stage at some great era in our national
affairs, and stood high then, are remembered
with affection and gratitude, but
the little party politician is forgotten as soon
as he walks off the stage. In this changing
world, how soon is the mere demagogue
forgotten? In his day, he impresses his retainers
with the idea, that, unless some favorite
theory is adopted, all is lost. It is
exploded, he disappears from our sight, and
the world moves on in safety. There is an
elasticity in the American character, not
existing to the same extent in any other nation.
Under any great national disappointment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
there may be, and there is, sometimes
a season of national gloom, but recovering
from such a state of mind, our people rouse
up all their wonted courage, and confiding
in their own strength, they move onward to
new enterprises, entertain new hopes, and
finally realise, and frequently more than
realise all their most sanguine expectations.
In the natural world, the storm and
the tornado may be as necessary as the
clear sunshine and the gentle shower, and
why should the mental world differ from
the natural one in this respect? “This is a
crisis,” says the demagogue—“a nation’s
fate depends on the issue of this crisis,” but
the mighty crisis passes by as harmless as
the Zephyr’s breath in May moves over the
meadow. These getters up of crises are,
on the whole, quite a harmless set of beings.
They keep up a ripple on the ocean
of human life and prevent a dead calm in
the political ocean. In this session of Congress
I have seen none of these crises and
panic makers in the two houses. The debates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
on the twenty-first rule, on the Oregon
question, on the army bill, on the tariff
and some other topics were ardent, long
and exciting, but they did not produce a
very angry debate. These several storms
passed over without doing much harm, like
a squall of wind without hail, or even much
rain descending to deluge the earth.</p>

<p>During Dr. <span class="smcap">Hammet’s</span> speech on the 21st
rule, I had a place, through the Doctor’s
politeness, a seat in the body of the House,
from which, by standing on my feet, I saw
every member in his place, and witnessed
the effect on the countenances of members,
which that speech produced. Those passages
which turned sixty faces pale, produced
convulsive laughter among the rest
of the members. The countenance of Mr.
Adams never changed from a serene aspect,
whereas the Ohio members mostly looked
unmoved as marble, in no wise excited by
the topics, except when the speaker alluded
to the old maids of Massachusetts. When
they were introduced into his speech, our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
members were taken by surprise, and they
laughed immoderately. Even Gen. Vance,
Judge Dean and all, with all their usual
gravity, laughed heartily, and forgot to be
grave. The hit was a fair one and well deserved.
Female fanatics are doing some
harm, and can do no good. On questions,
and even doubtful ones of great national
importance, our females would show more
wisdom to be silent, than to press forward
on the stage in buskins to show themselves
as players.</p>

<p>Many persons think the members do
wrong to indulge themselves in so much
speaking, but better make long speeches
than pass many bad laws. That too many
laws are made by state, territorial and national
legislation is certain. The mania for
speech making is not as bad as many suppose
it to be—it is the safety valve that lets
off the superfluous steam, otherwise boilers
would burst, and blow into fragments the
vessel of state. Viewed in this light, we
can tolerate it from motives of sympathy for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
the afflicted. Another good effect flows
from these long speeches, while they are
delivered, members can go into the library,
the lobby or the rotundo and amuse themselves
or converse with their friends. The
speech being made, it can be printed and
sent home to their constituents. They are
pleased and thus many ends are answered
by the delivering of a speech.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eloquence of Members of Congress.</span>—Under
this head I shall not say much, for
several reasons. The chambers are but
poorly calculated for hearing in them; the
places occupied by those who wish to hear
and report speeches, are not such ones as
they should be, if hearing be the object of
those who sit in them; the noise necessarily
made by three hundred persons, moving
about and sometimes talking and whispering;
the opening and shutting of doors and
the confused din, attendant on such an assemblage
of men; the many objects, such
as the <span class="smcap">Ladies</span> in the galleries of the House,
naturally draw off the eye from the debater,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
the ear from the sound of his voice and
the mind from the subject in discussion.
With all these abatements and all these impediments,
we need not wonder if the
speeches are not very correctly reported,
they being so imperfectly heard when they
are delivered. This circumstance gives rise
to every day explanations, almost, in both
houses, to correct erroneous reports of
speeches. But with all these impediments,
there is a very considerable number of good
speakers, especially in the Senate. It is
possible, however, that the Senate’s chamber
being a place wherein one can hear
better than in the gallery of the other house,
may have had quite an influence on my
opinion in this particular. Senator <span class="smcap">Choate</span>
is quite a favorite among his friends, as an
orator. His voice is clear, sufficiently loud
and distinct; his method is clear, his language
elegant, often beautiful; the impression
which he makes on the hearer is highly
agreeable. He rises neither too high nor
sinks too low for his subject, but flies along
over the subject at a suitable elevation. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
looks as if he were a man of great labor,
and not in very good health. He appears
to be care-worn, and as if he was over-worked
by the incessant toils of his station.
I have no personal acquaintance with him,
and speak merely from what I saw of him
a few moments at Dr. Sewall’s, and from
hearing him in the Senate chamber a few
times. He is the brother-in-law of the Doctor
and lodges at his house. Mr. Choate
represents the manufacturing and commercial
classes and has a laborious task to perform,
in opposition to restless men, who, it
appears to me, mistake their own interest
in opposing commerce and manufactures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John J. Crittenden</span>, a senator from Kentucky,
is a most delightful speaker. With
a melodious voice, clear method, clear sentences,
in which every word is fitly chosen,
so that no one could be changed for any
other word in its location that would do as
well in its place. His arguments are lucid,
his manner is so fascinating that he is a
model of forensic eloquence in a parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
debate. Honest, candid, sincere, pleasant,
sometimes eloquent, always happy in
his expressions, it is no wonder that he is
a very popular orator. On hearing him,
you esteem him as a gentleman, and love
him as a man. He was nominated by Mr.
Adams to the Senate of the United States
as a judge of the United States supreme
court, but was not confirmed, and Judge
M’Lean fills the place to which Mr. Crittenden
was nominated. He would have
made as excellent a judge, as he made a
member of General Harrison’s cabinet. He
has no enemy who personally knows him,
so pure, so sincere and candid is he in all
his intercourse with the world, that even
those who disagree in opinion with him,
love the man, his manners and his straight
forwardness of speech and of action. His
age may be forty-eight and he is quite grey
headed, of the common size and square
built. His lady has a young look and is still
handsome. She is always lady-like and
agreeable in her conversation and deportment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
In these respects she resembles the
ladies of Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee.
They always remind me of the West, and
recall to my mind the delightful recollections
of a large integral portion of my extended
life, spent among scenes and surrounded
by a people always dear to my
heart. No place, time or circumstances
will ever be able to obliterate these impressions
from my vivid recollections of a
delightful past. The Western people, possessing
as they do, unflinching courage, pure
patriotism, a love of liberty, of sincerity and
truth, decision of character, open heartedness
and sincerity, with broad and liberal
views, and possessing too an energy and a
determination to go forward, conquering
the forest and the prairie, they will soon
extend our dominion to the Pacific ocean.
Such a people will always go ahead of all
national legislation and compel Congress to
come limping and halting along on crutches
and stilts behind them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James T. Morehead</span>, the other Kentucky<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
senator, was formerly governor of that State.
He is six feet high or upwards, rather spare
in flesh, straight as an Indian, and he is
so agreeable in his manners and address, as
to be as he truly is the world’s idol. His
words flow along in a constant stream,
sweeter than honey. Sometimes he rises
into sublimity, and soars along on high, and
like our own eagle, revelling in the beams
of a clear sun. Sometimes he can be playful,
with an arch leer on his brow when he
is ironical. He can captivate with his witchery
of manner and of style. His method is
good, his sentences are clear, sometimes
pointed, sarcastic and withering. His manner
is winning and his arguments convincing.
He is shrewd, searching and occasionally
severe in his arguments, though not in
his language. His ideas may be hard, but
his words are soft, smooth and melodies.
He labors with his pen and his books incessantly,
sometimes more than his body can
well bear. Having come over into Ohio
and married and carried off a beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
amiable and good lady, the daughter of my
excellent friend, J. M. Espy, of Columbus,
I wish I had it in my power to present the
reader a short biographical sketch of Gov.
Morehead.</p>

<p>Under the head of eloquence, I will confess,
that although I have been months attending
here, sometimes conversing with
members of Congress, sometimes with other
persons from all parts of the Union—standing
in the rotundo or sitting in the library,
there conversing or reading, I always found
it an unpleasant task to hear speeches, unless
some one was speaking whom I knew
or greatly desired to hear. I went to hear
Dr. <span class="smcap">Hammet</span> of Mississippi, <span class="smcap">John Q. Adams</span>,
<span class="smcap">General Dromgoole</span>, <span class="smcap">Judge Dean</span>, <span class="smcap">John
B. Weller</span>, <span class="smcap">Schenck</span>, <span class="smcap">Vinton</span>, <span class="smcap">Florence</span>,
<span class="smcap">Van Meter</span>, <span class="smcap">Potter</span> and a few others, but
I had so much difficulty to get a seat where
I could hear, that I seldom made an attempt
to get a seat in the House. <span class="smcap">Hale</span> of New
Hampshire, when he spoke, could always
be heard and understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
It appeared to me, that our western members
were more eloquent on the Oregon
question than the eastern members, and
that the eastern members beat the western
ones on the tariff question all hollow. The
eastern members were learned, eloquent
and sensible whenever they spoke of manufactures,
commerce or trade. These
speeches, properly digested, would make
an instructive and useful volume, that would
be read by every body.</p>

<p>I took an interest in the army bill, and
contrived to hear a great deal of its discussion.
<span class="smcap">M’Cay</span>, <span class="smcap">Cave Johnson</span> and <span class="smcap">Black</span>
of Carolina never spoke a word in vain.
Mr. Black deserves a great deal of credit
for his exertions to reform the abuses of the
patronage of the government. The mad
ravings of the pets against him are recommendations
of him to his constituent, as
their faithful sentinel in Congress. He represents
a hardy, patriotic race of men,
whose ancesters fought bravely and well
for their country in the war of the revolution.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
The Cowpens, King’s mountain, and
all that country round about them are immortalised
by deeds of arms; and by patriotic
devotion to the interests and the glory
of our common country. The nation owes
that people a debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>I spent an evening with Mr. Black and
Mr. Simpson, of Pendleton, S. Carolina, at
their lodgings in the old capitol, kept by
Mrs. Hill. They are excellent members
of Congress, honest, capable and faithful representatives—none
better. They are
friendly to Mr. Calhoun. Mr. Black was
born near Mr. Calhoun, that is within five
miles of him, and Mr. Simpson lives where
Mr. Calhoun does, and is his near neighbor.
He thinks highly of Mr. Calhoun’s family
and says that it is the happiest and the best
one he ever knew. If my memory serves
me, I think there is a sort of relationship
by marriage between Mr. Simpson and Mr.
Calhoun.</p>

<p>In the Senate are a great many good speakers.
I heard Allen, Tappan, Choate, Benton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Woodbury, Buchanan, Crittenden, Upham,
Morehead and several others, who
spoke well and argued clearly, distinctly
and to the purpose. I have not room for a
criticism on their manner and matter, but I
was pleased to hear them speak so well on
all occasions. I wished to hear <span class="smcap">Rives</span> and
<span class="smcap">Archer</span>, but did not get an opportunity to
hear them, or even become personally acquainted
with them. As a Senate, we need
not be ashamed of that body, but the reverse
in all respects. <span class="smcap">M’Duffie</span> appears to
be out of health, and I fear that he is in a
decline that will carry him off before many
years. I should have been glad to hear
<span class="smcap">Bayard</span> of Delaware, to ascertain whether
he inherits his father’s talents, but I never
heard him. <span class="smcap">Foster</span> of Tennessee, I know
to be a man of talents and an excellent senator,
but I had not the pleasure to hear
him. He stands high at the bar as a lawyer,
and no one is more beloved than I know
him to be by his neighbors in Nashville,
where he lives when at home. Talented,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
learned and good, Tennessee may well be
proud of her beloved son.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">King</span> has gone to Russia, and
<span class="smcap">Lewis</span> has taken his place. General King,
like his friend Buchanan, is a bachelor; so
he can go abroad, having no family to detain
him here.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Digression.</span></h3>

<p>The influence of the Christian religion, it
appears to me, begins to operate beneficially
on our legislative assemblies, and it is
to be hoped that it will in the end melt
down in its crucible our whole people.
That religion is the great fountain-head of
republics. It teaches us that our Creator is
our Father, and that we are all brethren.
In some respects, there is a falling off from
the practices of our fathers—for instance,
family government is not what it once was.
In former days we had infancy, youth and
age, but by the present generation youth is
struck out of human life altogether. A boy
or a girl five years old, assumes the dress,
the manners and the airs of a young gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
or a young lady. Last January, at my
room, in the Broadstreet Hotel, in New
York, after hearing their youngest child
read to me, (she was only about four years
old) I inquired of her, if her sister never
curled her hair? which hung in beautiful
ringlets on her head. She replied, that “her
sister Sarah would, within a few days, curl
her hair, and then she was to have a beau!”
The remark pleased me greatly, because it
was so characteristic of these times. No
sooner is the hippen laid aside, than the
pantaloons, and the boots, and the cocked-up
hat follow, as the dress of the boy—and
the girl, is dressed like a young lady. Her
locks are curled, and she looks around her
for a beau! Of these things we mean not
to complain, but we merely note them as a
change effected in our manners, since the
last age, whether for better or for worse,
we do not say. The days of our fathers are
gone by, and this generation assumes to be
wiser than the former one was, but whether
a better one, on the whole, is at best
doubtful with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
We prefer Old Virginia, with her old
principles to all her new fangled ideas. In
some things she may be behind the age,
but that does not convince me that she is
the worse on that account. I prefer the
principles of Washington, Jefferson, Madison,
Monroe, Marshall and Upshur, to those
of Aaron Burr and the spoilers. The former
are pure gold, in my estimation, and
the latter are mere dross. The sons, and
the descendants generally of the Randolphs,
the Lees, the Masons, and a long list of
Pendletons and other revolutionary patriots
are true to the principles of their ancesters
and the republic. Long may such men and
such principles shed a lustre on the Old Dominion.
Rives and Archer represent Virginian
interest and principles in the Senate
of the United States. In the other house
I am ignorant, wholly, as to their representatives,
and so I say nothing of them. Gilmer
was quite popular in the House, but he
is no more. <span class="smcap">Summers</span> is a western Virginian—so
western that he is exactly like an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Ohioan in his manners and feelings. He
lives on the Kenhawa, and truly and efficiently
represents the people who send him
to Congress.</p>

<p>From our digression we come back to say,
on the subject of the tariff, that the eastern
members appeared to us to have the better
arguments. They said, in substance, that
the tariff of 1842 had injured no interest of
our country; that agriculture was more prosperous
than before; that manufactures were
more flourishing; that our navigation was
more active; public and private credit was
restored, both at home and abroad. These
members then enquired, whether it was
wise, prudent and statesmanlike to change
a law that worked so well? They contended
that the experience of all nations proved
that sudden and frequent changes in the
laws of any country, were highly injurious
to all classes of people. We do not use the
very words, but we give the sum and the
substance of what fell from the lips of many
friends of the present tariff law. It appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
to me that those who wished a new tariff,
took a very narrow view of the subject.
They looked at what they considered the
interest of their several districts of country,
without looking further around them on the
whole Union. It is a matter of opinion, and
feeling as I certainly did, coolly and calmly,
I made up a deliberate judgement, as
disinterested as it could be. We in Ohio
are an agricultural, manufacturing and commercial
people. These interests are in reality
the same; they prosper or fall together.
Mr. Jefferson, by his embargoes and restrictive
measures, made the people of New
England a manufacturing people, against
their wills at first, but following his advice,
they became a manufacturing as well as a
commercial people. Their industry, perseverance
and energy made them prosperous
and rich. The change in their pursuits
ruined thousands of them at the time, but
as soon as their prosperity was everywhere
apparent, there were not wanting those,
who envied and wished to ruin that prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
by frequent changes in our tariff
laws. Those who wished to check their
prosperity, remind us of a private soldier in
the revolutionary war, while he was suffering
corporeal punishment. When the lash
fell upon his shoulders, he cried out, “strike
lower, strike lower!” but when the lash
struck his loins, he cried out, “strike higher.”
Strike where the corporal would, the
culprit was not at all satisfied with the
blows, nor pleased with the corporal himself.
Could all our people be willing “to
live and let live,” it appears to us that we
should all be happier and better off, and in
that way become an united people in the
bonds of mutual interest and mutual affection.</p>

<p>All laws calculated to affect a whole nation
should never be changed for slight
causes, nor changed without giving the people,
and the whole people, time to duly reflect
upon such changes, in all their bearings
on the whole people. Such are our
ideas of that republican form of government,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
which was erected by our fathers, to promote
the happiness of the people, aye, of
the whole people. Keeping this great object
in view, the laws should be plain, simple
and few, and be changed as seldom as
possible, otherwise no man in any business
can make any safe calculations as to the
course he should pursue—what plans he
should form, or how he can execute them.
There is an union of interests, not always
duly considered. The farmer, the mechanic,
the manufacturer, the merchant and the
mariner have precisely the same interests
in the prosperity of all the great interests
of all our people. Destroy or greatly injure
any one class of people, and the whole body
politic feels the wound and suffers by
the injury. One class may feel it first, but
in the end, all feel it.</p>

<p>On all great national questions of policy,
time, reflection, prudence and caution seem
to be required by the dictates of patriotism
and true wisdom. And our legislators, and
indeed all our wise men, should always remember,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
and be sure never to forget, that
we Americans are a very exciteable people,
more so, much more so, than many nations
are in the north of Europe. Our southern
people may be the soonest moved by any
sudden impulse, but get our northern people
once fairly started, and they move like
a tornado. Knowing ourselves, and how
exciteable we are, let us endeavor to keep
cool, on all the political questions, which
agitate the public mind, from time to time.
Our republican institutions have been dearly
bought—with the blood of our ancestors,
freely shed, in the battle fields of glorious
memory, and on the mountain waves, where
our sailors fought, bled, died and conquered
in the cause, the holy cause of liberty.—When
the liberties of this country go down
to their graves, have we not reason to fear
that free government all over the world,
will be overwhelmed in one universal ruin?
May my eyes be closed in death before that
day arrives.</p>

<p>Having decided that the tariff case shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
be put down to the foot of our docket, on
the principle of want of more time for national
reflection, it follows as a matter of
course, almost, that we ought to put the
Oregon question at the foot of our docket
also, and continue it for a trial at the next
term of our high court of judicature. Whether
the Texas case shall be disposed of in the
same manner, we will not decide, until we
have ascended to our seat on the bench, and
there patiently heard the arguments of
counsel learned in the law, on the motion
for a continuance of the cause until the
next session of this honorable court.</p>

<p>The idea that the American people are
to be taken by surprise, and that six large
States ought to be added to this confederacy
by legerdemain, without notice and
without sufficient time for reflection on all
the consequences of such an addition to our
territory, calls for deliberation, reflection
and a solemn pause, like the stillness of a
Quaker’s silent meeting, before we decide
this question—especially in the affirmitive.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Let us hear it discussed openly in the Senate,
and in all places of public resort.</p>

<p>Our right to Oregon, up to the fifty-fifth
degree of north latitude, is quite clear and
our people will occupy that territory forthwith,
and then Congress will limp along
after them, carrying our laws to them. In
the mean time, villages, towns and cities
will rear their spires along the rivers, the
stage driver’s horn and the steam boat’s bell
will be heard there. The sound of the axe,
the hammer and the saw, will rival in speed
the roaring of the waters rushing over mill
dams, or dashing against the rocks in the
streams of Oregon. All these things will
soon be heard and seen there, but we can
wait a little time yet, until the nation is
ready to rush in one mass of men, to wash
their feet in the waters of the Pacific, as
they roll their briny waves on to our great
western boundary. As Mr. Owen said, in
the house, “the Pacific is our destination
and our destiny.”</p>

<p>Lay the question over, gentlemen, till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
next session of Congress. The prancing
steed and the nodding plume shall be seen
there and the star spangled banner shall
wave, and rustle in every breeze that
moves over the prairies, the hills and the
plains of our own farthest West. A rail-road
from Astoria to Boston can transport
the salmon of the Multnomah to our farthest
East. Between the salmon of Penobscot
and those of the Columbia river, let
the Bostonians decide which is preferable.
We will wait, sitting with gravity in a wig
and gown in our court, until the Bostonians
are called into it, to give their testimony on
a point of so much delicacy, in a matter of
taste, too, about which old Horace has said
there is no disputing.—“<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">De gustibus non disputandum.</i>”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Visit to Mr. Calhoun, Secretary of State.—Alexandria, its early history.—Reminisences
of General Washington.—Memoir of Mr. Anthony Charles
Cazenove; a most interesting tale.—He was the old partner of Albert Gallatin,
at New Geneva, Pennsylvania.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the fifth day of April, I went early in
the morning to see Mr. Calhoun, the new
Secretary of State. I found him already in
his office, attending to his official duties. It
was long before office hours, and I had a
long conversation with him. He received
me most cordially and entertained me most
agreeably for an hour or two. When it
was announced to him that Mr. Chilton, a
member of Congress, had called to see him,
I retired to call on Mrs. Murphy, of Ohio,
and her son, who were putting up near the
Secretary’s office. After spending an hour
or two with them, I called again at the Secretary’s
office, but found him engaged with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the Texan ministers, Mr. Henderson and
Mr. Van Zandt. The messenger brought
me a slip of paper with Mr. Calhoun’s place
of residence written on it, “at Mrs. King’s,
between 13th and 14th streets, on F st.”
I went thither, and waited not long but until
Mr. Calhoun and his son had arrived and
dined. The Secretary came into the parlour
where I was sitting, and we conversed
together several hours, until General Anderson
of Tennessee came, when I took
my leave of Mr. Calhoun. During these
interviews I had in my mind two regrets:
first, that I had never before in my lifetime
had an opportunity to converse with him so
freely on a great variety of matters, deeply
interesting to the people of these United
States; and secondly, that my <em>first</em> was to
be my <em>last</em> opportunity of conversing with
Mr. Calhoun.</p>

<p>Mr. Calhoun, in conversation, is as great
as he is in every thing else. He can say a
great deal in a few words. His language is
appropriate and as beautiful as one could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
possibly imagine it to be. He is in the full
possession of all his corporeal and mental
powers, he sees every thing at a glance of
his mind, and he can speak as easily as he
thinks. He is unquestionably one of the
most talented men in the nation. It is quite
possible that he has been treated very ungratefully
by the men, who have been
raised into high places by Mr. Calhoun
himself. Without a particle of intrigue in
his composition—unacquainted entirely
with the machinery of party management
and party drill, he has stood no chance of
success among such men. He appeared to
know and to feel this, though he has always
scorned to stoop to such low means
of rising into the highest office in the Union.
He has not a particle of ill will towards his
enemies, and, he said, that he had taken a
real pleasure in doing good to those who
were employing themselves in their endeavors
to injure him, although he well knew
what they were doing at that moment
when he was serving them. He has come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
here, merely to treat with England and
Texas, and having finished his intended labors,
he will resign his present office, and
retire to the high ground where he dwells,
there to spend the remainder of his days.
Just back of the country where he lives, the
Alleghany mountains rise to an altitude of
seven thousand feet above the sea, which
is higher than the White mountains in New
Hampshire.</p>

<p>In the vallies of the Alleghany, near him,
Indian corn grows and comes to perfection
four thousand feet above the sea. Though
I did not ask him, yet, I suspect that at such
an elevation it is the New England corn,
and not our gourd seed corn. He tells me,
that on his elevated ground, where he lives
the climate is nearly the same, as that of
the District of Columbia. He has no ambition
for public life, its cares and responsibilities.
After being thirty-five years in
office, he desires to retire from it, and be at
peace at home, surrounded as he is by a family
endeared to him by all the ties which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
none but a parent can feel. He has five
sons and two daughters. The son with him
here, is an officer in the army—a promising
young man. He appeared to think that his
part of the Union had been wholly neglected
by the general government. If that be
the fact, and I am sure he thinks so, the representatives
from South Carolina, should
use their endeavors to obtain their due
share of the public patronage. To strengthen
the bonds of our Union by mutual aid
and mutual affection, should be the constant
aim of all our national legislation. I told
Mr. Calhoun that Ohio had paid twenty
millions of dollars for her lands, into the
United States treasury, whereas the people
of the Atlantic States had gotten their lands
originally, merely for settling on them. Mr.
Calhoun in reply stated that Wayne’s war,
with all its expenditures, must be charged
on Ohio and Indiana.</p>

<p>I told Mr. Calhoun that within ten years
from this time, the national government
would be in our hands in the West for safe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
keeping, and so will remain thenceforth
and forever. This idea, I told him, had its
full weight on our minds—it made us bear
and forbear—bear our evils and forbear to
use any violent means now, to acquire what
would, of its own accord soon fall into our
possession, and be forever ours.</p>

<p>General Anderson of Tennessee, coming
in here, I left Mr. Calhoun with the most
friendly impressions towards him, which
will never wear off from my mind during
my life-time. Devoid of all intrigue, he is
too honest a man to compete with the little
men, who have always opposed him. He
will only be called for, when great and
commanding powers of mind are imperiously
demanded by some great emergency.
Like a great lamp, he shines to give light
for the benefit of others, who see by the aid
of its lustre. Perhaps it is best that the
greatest talents are unemployed, except in
cases of emergency. They are the army
in reserve, upon which a defeated party in
advance can fall back and be saved from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
destruction. Why so many incompetent
men should rise into high places of trust,
while the greatest and the best ones should
be passed by, is not always seen. Envy of
living merit may be the cause.</p>

<p>Mr. Calhoun’s private character is pure
and spotless. He never had any vicious habit
of any sort, nor indulged in any vice. There
are very few such public men in this nation,
or even in this world, and there is no better
one anywhere. Whether he belongs to
any church, I do not know but that he practises
all the christian virtues is certain. His
hair is grey, but his step is strong and elastic,
and his body like his mind is as strong
and as active as it ever was. For strength
of thought, deep, vigorous, keen, searching,
discriminating, methodical, logical and clear
Mr. Calhoun has no superior in this nation.
His feelings are mellowed down by years
and by a large experience in the affairs of
the world and all its vicissitudes. His great
learning, derived from books—his agreeable
manners, derived from a good heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
and from his associations with the best society
in the nation; his business talents;
his industrious habits, and all his other great
qualifications, eminently fit him for his present
high station, and for even the highest
station in this republic. The Senate did
but yield to the unanimous desire of all our
citizens here, when they unanimously confirmed
the nomination of <span class="smcap">John C. Calhoun</span>,
as Secretary of State. In whatever station
he is, we may always feel assured that a
talented, patriotic and good man occupies
it, who will faithfully, honestly and correctly
do his duty at all times and in all emergencies.</p>

<p class="p2 sigright">
<span class="smcap">Alexandria</span>, <span class="smcap">April</span> 10th.
</p>

<p>I came here yesterday, to spend a few
days—to rusticate. This city of ten thousand
people is made up of an agreeable,
well informed and industrious population.
The streets all cross each other at right
angles, like those of Philadelphia. It is free
from the dust, which loads the air of Pennsylvania<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
avenue at this time, and is, on the
whole, a better place for me than capitol-hill,
where I was so happily located, at Mrs.
Ballard’s, within two minutes’ walk of the
capitol, its rotundo and library. This spot
is more retired from company, so agreeable
to me as to take off my mind from my business.
On attending the market here, the
most prominent object in it, was the fishes,
such as shad, herring, &amp;c., just taken in this
river, and brought here for sale. I saw yesterday
three large shad sold for a quarter of
a dollar, and single ones, large, fresh and
fair, for ten cents each! The quantities taken
are great, and a great many wagons
from the country, back of this city, and
from Maryland and Pennsylvania were here
for the purpose of carrying them away. Before
I came here, I heard much of the decay
of the city, but on my arrival I found
none of it. I found signs of thrift, but none
of decay. Houses were repairing, the people
were all employed in some useful calling;
the streets are all paved, with good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
side-walks, and what surprised me, was,
that I saw no coffee-houses where spirits
are retailed, in this city of ten thousand people.
There are only two taverns in it, and
one of the innkeepers sells no ardent spirits
in his house. I am now writing these lines
in his inn. I doubt much, whether such
another town of the size of this can be
found in America, where no more intoxicating
liquors are drank in it. I have now
lying before me, a record of the first town
meeting in this old American town, and I
extract from it the following, viz.</p>

<p>“At a meeting of the majority of the trustees
of Alexandria town, July 13th, 1749.
Present: Richard Osborn, Wm. Ramsay,
John Carlyle, John Pagan, Garrard Alexander
and Hugh West, Gent.”</p>

<p>What a record! Ninety-five years almost
since this was a frontier town, and then
the majority of the trustees held their
first meeting, of which any record remains.
Before that time, the place must have been
occupied by settlers, and must have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
laid out as a town, into lots, because the
same record shows that John West, junior,
was appointed a clerk of the town, and the
proceedings of the meeting were recorded
by their clerk, and his book, in manuscript,
lies before me! John West, junior, was
“appointed cryer to sell the lotts at publick
sale, within five minutes, from the time they
are set to sale.” The price of the lots is
given in the record, in pistoles. No. 36
was the first lot sold at the public sale, and
John Dalton was the purchaser, at 19 pistoles.
Among the purchasers of the lots,
we find the names of Lawrence Washington,
W. Fairfax and Geo. Fairfax, Nathaniel
Harrison, Wm. Fitzhugh, Wm. Ramsay
and Major Henry Fitzhugh, besides the
names of the trustees first named, and their
clerk and Roger Lindon and Allan McRae.</p>

<p>I visited the printing office on Saturday
morning, April 13th, and introduced myself
to the editor, a pleasant sensible and obliging
man. The Alexandria Gazette was established
by Samuel Snowden in 1800. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
was continued by the original proprietor
until his death in 1831. Since that time it
has been conducted and owned by his son,
Edgar Snowden—it is therefore one of the
oldest newspaper establishments in the
United States.</p>

<p>Between this place and Washington there
are two steam boats running, starting almost
every hour of the day from each city, and
passing each other about half-way between
Washington and Alexandria. They start
at five in the morning, and their last trip
commences at five in the evening. They
charge twelve and a half cents for the passage.
Some of the officers of the departments
live here, and daily pass the distance
between the two cities. A stage coach
runs between them also several times daily.</p>

<p>The citizens of Alexandria often attend
the debates in Congress, and know what is
doing in Washington as well almost as those
who live there.</p>

<p>I visited the Alexandria museum over
the market house, and among the collection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
there, I saw the mantle in which George
Washington was christened; his masonic
robes, apron and gloves; his pistols, presented
to him by Louis XVI; a model, in
stone, of the Bastile, presented to him by
the national assembly of France; his pack-saddle,
used in the revolutionary war; his
flag, borne by his body guard in that war;
the first British flag, captured in that war,
called Alpha by Washington; the last flag
taken in that war from Cornwallis; La Fayette’s
flag—blue; Decatur’s flag; Paul
Jones’ flag, on board the Bonne Homme
Richard, in his battle with the Serapis;
Gen. Morgan’s flag, borne by his Virginia
regiment; and a great many other relics of
revolutionary times. General Washington’s
letter to the cotillion party, which used to
assemble in the house where I am located,
is in the museum. In this letter the General
declines to meet with them, on account
of Mrs. Washington’s age. What thrilling
recollections of times gone by, do these relics
stir up within us? What a crowd of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
emotions, of all sorts, rush upon the mind,
when looking on these memorials of former
days, former ideas and opinions? of old
customs and ancient manners, compared
with modern ones? We live in a world
that is passing away—in its habits, customs,
dress, weapons of warfare; all is changed,
changing and never will be stable, scarcely
an hour! Ninety-four years ago, this spot,
where this city is, was surrounded by a
dense forest, on the verge of civilization,
now it is quite on the eastern side of
our domain.</p>

<p>There is a large market house here, of
brick, over which are rooms for the several
public offices, and in the third story is the
museum. The mayor, clerk, auditor, &amp;c.
have their offices in the first story above
the market house. The market is well
supplied with meat, fish and vegetables. I
saw too in it many flowers and small evergreen
trees, in a proper state for planting
them. The vegetables, flowers and trees
were offered at very low prices—hardly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
sufficient to pay for bringing them to market.
Those who brought them appeared
to be poor, with families to support.</p>

<p>The rail-road from Cumberland to Baltimore
has injured Alexandria, by taking
some of the trade of the upper country
away from this district. An extension of
the canal to this city will bring back some
of the trade which it has lost temporarily.
The water in the wells of this city is not
good, except a few in the suburbs, from
which the city is well supplied. By taking
the water out of the canal, it can be easily
conveyed to the houses and supply all the
citizens with healthful water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Religious Sects.</span>—There are episcopalians,
presbyterians, methodists, catholics,
baptists, and perhaps some other denominations
of christians. They appear to live together
in unity, and agree to disagree in
opinion about their several forms of worship.
To the community at large it matters
little what may be their several forms,
so as they have the same great fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
principles of charity and benevolence towards
each other and towards God and
man. There are too, some quakers, as I perceive
by their dress and conversation.—They
are the same industrious, neat, quiet,
friendly people every where.</p>

<p>On Sunday April 14th I attended church
in the morning at the first presbyterian
church, and in the afternoon at Christ
church, the oldest episcopalian church. In
the forenoon I heard the Rev. Mr. Harrison.
Calling at Mr. Cazenove’s to accompany
him, he being absent, I went to the dwelling
of his son-in-law, expecting to find him
there, but, learning the object of my calling,
a daughter of my deceased friend, the
late Colonel <span class="smcap">Fowle</span>, came forward, and accompanied
me to the church; she was a
child nine or ten years old. She behaved
perfectly lady-like, and conducted me to
her mother’s pew, where her parent was
already seated. The congregation was not
a large one, though a very serious and devout
one, to whom the preacher addressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
a very good discourse. Colonel <span class="smcap">Fowle</span> was
lost in the <span class="smcap">Moselle</span>, when that vessel was
blown up at Cincinnati, a few years since.
I shook hands with him, and bid him farewell,
only fifteen minutes before his death.
I had been personally well acquainted with
the Colonel for many years, and had spent
many happy hours at different places in the
West with him, on many a day, and I always
had a high regard for him. His little
daughter resembles him very much in her
looks and manners. I could not refrain from
thinking how happy he would have been,
had he seen her, and noticed how lady-like
his daughter was, in her behaviour, while
conducting his old friend to church, in this
city. If spirits hover around those friends
whom they have left behind them in this
world, and take a peculiar pleasure in any
thing that relates to them in this life, the
spirit of my departed friend, Col. Fowle,
must have been pleased to see me seated in
his pew, yesterday, at church, with his widow,
her father and his daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
In the afternoon I went to the church
where Washington used to attend divine
worship, and found in it but two persons—ladies,
dressed in mourning. I stated to
them my case, that I was a perfect stranger,
who wished to attend their meeting at that
time. One of them offered me a seat in
her pew, which I accepted. It was near
the pulpit, and she pointed out to me the
pew in which General Washington used to
sit; it was the largest one in the church.
At the proper time, the congregation assembled,
some three hundred people perhaps,
and three-fourth of them were females.
The weather was warm and it was
after dinner. Where the men were I did
not know, but they were not in the church.
Two preachers at last appeared, and began
the service. The regular minister read the
service, but another clergyman preached
the sermon. I soon discovered that this
was an old school episcopalian church.—Their
creed told me so, because it stated
what Jesus himself has contradicted on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
cross. The creed said, he descended into
hell, but he himself told the thief by his side
suspended on the cross, that on <em>that day</em> he
would be in paradise! The sermon was
an eloquent one, and so far as I could judge,
very correct in its doctrinal points. As a
literary composition, it was good too, and
its delivery occupied an hour perhaps. The
regular preacher was Mr. Dana and the one
who officiated, was the Rev. Mr. Johnson.
Young, or middled aged at most, tall, erect,
active and well educated, they may yet live
long to be useful and successful preachers.</p>

<p>Forty-five years since, General Washington
attended this church and sat in the pew
now occupied by a square built, heavy man,
fifty years old, possibly. To me every person
in the church was an entire stranger.
The church has a good organ, and on each
side of the pulpit are printed on boards the
ten commandments on the south, and the
Lord’s prayer and their creed on the north,
or right hand side of the minister in his
desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Reuben Johnson is the present clerk and
auditor of the city. From him I obtained
leave to inspect all his records. Joseph
Eaches, Esq., is the present mayor, from
whom I have derived very useful information,
concerning this city.</p>

<p>The people of Alexandria have in their
manners the simplicity and straight-forwardness
of a people in a rural village.—They
have the hospitality of their ancesters
of Charles II. time, when the Scotch, under
Lord Fairfax settled the northern neck of
Virginia. The pure morals and pure principles
of those primitive times have been
handed down unsoiled and uncorrupted to
the people who now dwell here. Should
the seat of the national government be removed
farther west, Alexandria would not
suffer much by that change. The Potomac,
broad, deep and navigable, would still roll
its tide from Georgetown to the sea. The
industry, enterprise, economy, morals, religion
and patriotism of the people would remain,
and render prosperous, useful, good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
and happy, a thriving people. An increasing
city will forever remain here an ornament
of the nation. This is a nucleus,
around which men of good principles may
rally, and from this point spread far and
wide, sound morals and sound principles of
all sorts. Near this town Washington was
born and died, and his spirit hovers over
this people. His example, his precepts and
his principles govern Alexandria still. We
see it in every thing all around us.</p>

<p>The stage house, where I am, is kept by
Mr. <span class="smcap">George Wise</span>, and it is the best in the
city. As such I take pleasure in recommending
it to travellers.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude my remarks on Alexandria
better, than by introducing to the
reader Mr. <span class="smcap">A. C. Cazenove</span>, a native of
Geneva, Switzerland, but now and for many
years past an enterprising merchant and
importer of foreign goods. Mr. Cazenove
is as stirring a man, as there is in Alexandria.
At my request he drew up a short
memoir of his life, which, in his own words,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
I present to the reader. Gen. <span class="smcap">Archibald
Henderson</span> married Mr. Cazenove’s eldest
daughter and Colonel Fowle his youngest
one.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Memoir of Mr. Cazenove.</span></h3>

<p>The cradle of the Cazenove family was
Nismes in France, though it is probable,
from their name and coat of arms, that they
were originally from Italy or Spain, where
you find some Casanovas and Casanuovas.</p>

<p>Being protestants, they had to fly at the
revocation of the edict of Nantes, and took
refuge in Geneva, in Switzerland, from
whence some of them afterwards branched
off to Lausanne, in Switzerland, to Holland,
England, France, and lastly to the United
States. This last event took place during
the summer of 1794, when the leaders of
the dreadful French revolution fomented
one of a similar character, only on a smaller
scale, in the little republic of Geneva,
then not one of the cantons of Switzerland,
but in close alliance with that ancient and
admirable confederation. The object of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the French being the geographical situation
of Geneva, being fortified and by nature
one of the gate-ways into France,
Switzerland and Italy, besides its great
wealth for an inland city, and the high
state of information possessed by the generality
of its inhabitants, being acknowledged
to be one of the luminaries of the
world.</p>

<p>Although France had succeeded in overturning
their old form of government, and
substituting in a population, then amounting
to about 25,000 souls in the city and
about 15,000 in the surrounding villages
and country, a national assembly as democratic
as it could well be. They were
attached to their independence and desirous
so to remain. It therefore became necessary
for Roberspierre and the leading
jacobins of France, to find some pretext
for taking possession of Geneva, for which
purpose they surrounded it (being then
in possession of Savoy and having military
posts close by) with the worst of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
their jacobins, and such Genevans as had
been banished from it for any cause, and
in one night, with the help of their sattelites
in Geneva and their own people
which they had introduced into the city,
took possession of the three gates of the
city, arsenal and powder magazines. They
armed the most desperate amongst them,
to intimidate others, and early next day
went and dragged the heads of our best families
and distinguished citizens, into two
large warehouses, used before that for public
granneries, to the number of about 400
persons, and established a national tribune,
before which they brought several of the
best, most virtuous and patriotic citizens of
Geneva, but ranked by them as aristocrats,
which they pretended to have conspired
against the independence of the republic;
the very thing they had themselves in
view, and were aiming at. Nor could they
have had the reign one single day, but for
the knowledge that France was ready to
pounce upon Geneva, if any thing like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
scuffle had taken place, to avoid which the
people of Geneva thought it best to submit
for a while to the tyranny of their own jacobins.
As it was impossible to substantiate
any charge against such men, however
depraved their revolutionary tribunal was,
they were necessarily acquitted and sent
to the common jail for safe keeping. This
however so enraged their blood-thirsty
Marseillois, (the worst of jacobins) that
they forced the jail during the night, and
by torch light shot sixteen of the best men
Geneva ever possessed, and so overawed the
revolutionary tribunal itself, as to compel
it to take on itself the responsibility of so
atrocious a deed.</p>

<p>In order, however, to appease in some
respects public indignation, the revolutionary
tribunal brought before them forty of
the prisoners, amongst whom were Mr.
Paul Cazenove, myself, and his two and
only sons, John Anthony and Anthony
Charles, when, after having charged them
also of conspiracy against the republic, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
threatening them in an awful manner if
they persisted, they were allowed to return
to their respective families, where I
found seven jacobins guarding my mother
at her country seat, not allowing her to
leave her own room, and I was not even
allowed to go in and see her, nor have I
seen her since; for my brother and myself,
under cover of the night, with the help of
a Swiss boat, escaped the second night,
through the lake to Copet, the nearest
town in Switzerland, on the lake of Geneva,
where we were joined by our cousin
Fazy, one of the defenders of Lyons when
beseiged by order of the French national
convention. Having long felt that we could
not live in peace in Geneva, under the sway
of the jacobins, we and several other Genevans
had determined to leave it, for a
while at least, and under the impression
that the jacobinical principles of revolutionary
France were destined to go through
Europe, we determined to come to America,
where the revolution had happily terminated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
and where we had already friends
and relatives. In order, therefore, to avoid
the French armies, which were then making
their second incursion into Flanders and
Germany, we proceeded through the interior
of Germany to Hamburg, where we
were met by other Genevans, who had
formed the plan of emigrating to America.
There we heard of the death of Roberspierre,
and were all on the point of abandoning
our project, but we determined to
persevere in it, because every leader of the
French convention having been heretofore
succeeded by one still more sanguinary
than the last, we did not expect any change
for the better. We all, to the number of
eight, therefore, embarked together with
our four Swiss servants, for Philadelphia,
where we landed in November 1794, and
were soon after joined by three other Genevans,
two of whom, with their wives, had
left Geneva after us for the United States.
There I found my cousin, Mr. Theophilus
Cazenove, the same after whom Cazenovia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
in the State of New York, is called, who
had made in that State and in Pennsylvania,
as agent of wealthy capitalists of Holland,
the extensive purchase of the Holland
company. Also my cousin Odier of the
house of Odier &amp; Bousquet Brothers, and
soon after Mr. Albert Gallatin, then a distinguished
member of the Legislature of
Pennsylvania, joined us.</p>

<p>A number of Genevans having, while yet
in Geneva, much approved our intention of
removing to the United States, and desired
that we should remember them and also
prepare a retreat for them. We formed the
plan of a large landed company, in which
a number of influential individuals became
interested. But having ascertained during
the spring of 1795 that, justly adverse to
emigrate, the French revolution and that
of Geneva having assumed a somewhat milder
course, after the fall of Roberspierre,
we were not likely to be joined by other
Genevans as we expected, we relinquished
the plan of our landed company, and I formed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
a co-partnership with Mr. Albert Gallatin,
his brother-in-law, Mr. J. W. Nicholson,
and two other gentlemen, under the
firm of Albert Gallatin &amp; Co., and purchased
a tract of land at the mouth of George’s
Creek, in Fayette county, Pennsylvania,
where we located the town of New Geneva,
on the Monongehela river, and established
stores, built mills, glass-works, &amp;c.
I remained there until having married in
Alexandria, where I then settled myself
for life. Some years after that, the Swiss
government, having thought it desirable, for
the first time, to establish consuls in the
United States, unexpectedly to me, knowing
nothing of their intentions, I received
from the federal government of that country,
their appointment of Swiss consul for
the middle and southern States, with a very
kind and obliging request from them to accept
it; which was the more flattering, as
it had been unsought by me, and though it
was impossible for me to forget the country
of my birth, or my attachment for Switzerland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
ever to be weakened, still it was very
pleasing for me to see that I had not been
forgotten by her, and had such agreeable
opportunities afforded me of keeping up an
intercourse with that excellent government
and equally excellent people, which it is
the delight of all travellers to exalt above
all other nations.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Officers of the government.—Remarks on the permanency of the seat of government.—No
authority in the constitution to remove it.—Monomaniacs,
one who fancies himself in paradise! and the other expects to be elected
the next president!—Other monomaniacs equally crazy.—<span class="smcap">Local Information.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The chief clerks, such as M’Clintock
Young of the treasury department, Mr.
Moore of the general land office, Wm. B.
Randolph of the treasurer’s office, Mr. Pleasants,
Thos. L. Smith the Register, and M.
Nourse, his chief clerk, are always at their
posts, attending to their duties. Without
just such men, the public business could not
be done. In the state department, Messrs.
Winder and Carroll and Pleasonton are always
engaged in their proper business. Perhaps
there is not an idler in that department.
Major Lewis and all his clerks, James Eakin,
his chief clerk, Josiah Polk and all, are
very industrious and attentive to their duties.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
So in the general post office, M. St.
Clair Clarke and all his clerks, the several
assistant postmasters general, and Judges
Smith and Hotchkiss, S. B. Beach, Stone,
Gen. Allen and all the clerks labor hard all
day long. In the offices of the war department
and in the naval office, I am not sufficiently
informed to tell the reader anything
about them. Generals Towson, Abert,
Bomford, Gibson and all the officers of their
grade are always industrious, always attentive
to their business. In all these stations
no changes could be made for the better I
am sure. Judge Blake of the general land
office deserves an honorable mention, for
having appointed Wm. Darby and several
others like him, clerks; and for his kind
treatment of all his subordinates. The
changes of heads of department, which are
more and more frequent of late years than
formerly produce changes among the clerks.
No sooner is any new head of department
inducted into his office, than he seeks forthwith
a place for some relative or dependant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
If there be any vacancy, this creature
fills it; if there be no vacancy, the new
head of department creates a vacancy and
puts his creature in it. When any secretary
leaves his office, he endeavors to keep
his dependant still on the list of office holders.
James Madison Porter left three relatives
in offices, two Porters and a Wolf.
These secretaries being changed very often
of late years, renders the tenure of office
very uncertain, very precarious. In looking
back on the last few years, we see
changes of heads of department so frequent
as to render it almost ludicrous for a secretary
to undertake to get personally acquainted
with his clerks, before he goes
back into private life again. Why is it the
ambition of any man in this country to be
a secretary or a head of department? And
yet, it is evident enough that those who fill
these stations, think highly of them—their
gait, their air and address prove this. Looked
these gentlemen on their stations, as
the whole nation does, these offices would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
not be coveted at all. Such men as Calhoun
are exceptions, because they act as if
they knew what they were doing and felt
all their responsibility and all the cares of
office. In his manners and industry Mr.
Calhoun naturally reminds one of old times,
when men in high stations were beloved
by all who had any business to transact
with them. From all I see and hear, I
doubt whether the frequent changes in our
highest officers operate beneficially on the
public interest. However, if the chief
clerks are not changed, perhaps, the head
of the department being often changed does
no great harm, because the chief clerk is in
reality the head of department. M’Clintock
Young has been in reality the secretary
of the treasury for four years past.
Without him every thing would have gone
to ruin, long ago, in the department over
which he presides.</p>

<p>Former presidents, from Jefferson downward,
used to visit the rooms of clerks and
inspect the offices very often, but his Excellency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
John Tyler is not so hard on clerks
and heads of bureaus. He never visits
them—at least I have not seen him on any
such tours of duty. General Jackson has
often gone with me to the rooms of secretaries
and clerks, to inspect their books and
to ascertain how they kept their accounts.
Having doubled and trebled the force in
the offices, renders such tours of inspection
unnecessary, in order to do all the business
of the several departments faithfully,
correctly and well. Two families hold four
clerkships each; so I hear from an authentic
source.</p>

<p>Should any citizen of the United States
wish to know exactly what is done with
every cent of Uncle Sam’s money, let him
call on Thomas L. Smith, the register of
the treasury, and he can there see it at a
glance. Maj. Smith holds the purse strings.
If any one wishes to see models of all the
light-houses in the world, let him call on
Mr. Pleasanton in the state department and
there he will find them, and a perfect gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
to explain every thing that relates
to these light-houses. If any one wishes to
see all the books, for which American authors
claim a copy-right, let him call on the
Messrs. Winder and Carroll in the state department,
and he will find the books, and
the gentlemen in whom Judge Upshur most
confided, as his confidential clerks. Mr.
Calhoun will extend to them the same confidence
as Judge Upshur did. The former
is the son of General Winder and the latter
is the descendant of Daniel Carrol of Duddington,
a signer of the declaration of independence.</p>

<p>To those who visit the city from a distance,
local information may be useful, and
we give such as we suppose may be of service
to them. If the stranger wish to tarry
only a few days, having no business but to
see the city, perhaps Brown’s or Gadsby’s
will best suit him; but if his business be
with Congress, capitol hill will best suit
him, and he can put up with Mrs. Ballard,
Mrs. Owner, Mrs. Hill or some other keeper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
of a boarding house—Mrs. Whitney for
instance. I prefer Mrs. Ballard’s, although
the others are all good houses, with good
accomodations. If the stranger’s business
is with the departments, he can stop at Fuller’s,
or Mrs. Galabrun’s on the avenue, or
Butler’s on F street, or Mrs. Tilley’s on
Tenth, near the avenue. But there are a
hundred other boarding houses, as good as
need be, such as Mrs. Hamilton’s, Miss
Polk’s, Mrs. Arguelles’ and a long list of
good houses. Five thousand persons can
be well accommodated in Washington city.
For the size of it, this has more and better
accomodations for travellers, than any other
city with which I am personally acquainted.
I prefer it to any other east of the Alleghanies,
but until the late riots, Philadelphia
stood highest with me. It may be owing
to my long acquaintance with this to me
delightful city, that I prefer it.</p>

<p>However much we may loathe occasional
loafers, who come here, and quite too many
of them do come here, yet the people themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
are as good, as the people of any other
section of the Union. As a whole, they
are more polished in their manners than
any other people in the confederacy. Trusting
to the constitution itself, in accordance
with which, and the laws made under its
express provisions, this district was selected
for the <span class="smcap smaller">PERMANENT</span> seat of government,
many persons settled here, and fixed on the
District of Columbia as <em>their permanent</em> residence.
Their all is here, their families
and their whole fortunes. Until the seat
of government was fixed here, it never had
been fixed permanently any where. Those
who had the power delegated to them, having
expended all the power over the subject,
that ever was delegated to any persons
to fix on the site of the general government,
no power to change it, remains in
the constitution. That vast regions have
been acquired and added to the Union,
without a particle of constitutional authority
for the acquisition or addition to the original
States, is true; but that fact cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
change the constitution itself, so far as a
permanent seat of government is concerned
in the question.</p>

<p>However, let us change this serious subject
for one serio-comic. We have heard
of two maniacs to-day—monomaniacs. One
of them seriously believes himself in paradise!
and the other believes that he will
be the next president! Paradise was a
place of innocense, the abode of happiness,
a bed of roses, but the presidency is a bed
of thorns. Reposing on such a bed, who
could sing, with Thomas Moore,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Will you come to the bower I have shaded for you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where your bed shall be roses bespangled with dew?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>We hear to-day also, that a monomaniac,
another one altogether, thinks that if he
can get a certain man elected president in
1844, he, the maniac, will be elected president
in 1848! Still other maniacs expect
to be foreign ministers! What strange
delusions in this deluded and deluding
world are all these vagaries of the brain?
Shall we call in Dr. <span class="smcap">Mayo</span>, or shall we import<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
forthwith all the helebore which both
the Anticyras produce and administer it all
to these afflicted patients? or what shall
we do to restore these men to a sound
state of mind? Who can calculate the
chances of the next election? We cannot
tell by 400,000 individual votes, and we
suppose we know just as much about it as
the voters themselves do at this moment.</p>

<p>Sanguine politicians think they know,
but they do not know more than we do,
whose minds are not made up yet what we
shall do, or how we shall vote—perhaps,
not at all this autumn. Instead of “a light
house of the skies” and buildings for “storm
kings,” telegraphs, &amp;c. &amp;c. why not appropriate
money for a lunatic asylum of such
large dimensions that it could accommodate
thousands who come here with their
humbugs of all sorts, asking for national aid
and support?</p>

<p>Perhaps we ought to have added a chapter
on <span class="smcap">Humbugs</span>, in addition to our <span class="smcap">Mysteries</span>,
of this city. Kind reader, it is too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
late now for such a chapter, our whole
little volume being all filled up and nearly
all its contents are already printed.</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
